# Docs folder

The `/docs` folder houses all markdown files. The page structure loosely maps to the routing on the site since paths can be changed in the frontmatter.

## Versioning

This folder can also contain components, assets, and whatever else is meant to be versioned when the docusaurus versioning script is run. For example, if there is a page component that is only relevant to the `layout` section in the current version of Ionic, it could be added to a `_components/` folder in `docs/layout/`. When the versioning script is run, the component will be copied to `versioned_docs/version-{X}/layout/_components/` and there will now be a separate component in `docs/layout/_components/` that can be deleted or updated to the latest version. The same concept applies to images and other files.

If components are meant to be shared across versions, they can be put in `src/components/`. If images and other served files are meant to be shared across versions they can be put in `static/`.

## Auto Generated Files

All markdown files in these directories are generated from [scripts](/scripts):

- `docs/api/`
- `docs/cli/commands/`
- `docs/native/`

Accordion group is a container for accordion instances. It manages the state of the accordions and provides keyboard navigation.

See the [Accordion](./accordion) documentation for more information.


## Interfaces

### AccordionGroupChangeEventDetail

```typescript
interface AccordionGroupChangeEventDetail<T = any> {
  value: T;
}
```

### AccordionGroupCustomEvent

While not required, this interface can be used in place of the `CustomEvent` interface for stronger typing with Ionic events emitted from this component.

```typescript
interface AccordionGroupCustomEvent<T = any> extends CustomEvent {
  detail: AccordionGroupChangeEventDetail<T>;
  target: HTMLIonAccordionGroupElement;
}
```

import EncapsulationPill from '@components/page/api/EncapsulationPill';

<EncapsulationPill type="shadow" />


Accordions provide collapsible sections in your content to reduce vertical space while providing a way of organizing and grouping information. All `ion-accordion` components should be grouped inside `ion-accordion-group` components.

## Basic Usage

import Basic from '@site/static/usage/v8/accordion/basic/index.md';

<Basic />

## Toggle Accordions

Which accordion is open is controlled by setting the `value` property on `ion-accordion-group`. Setting this property allows developers to programmatically expand or collapse certain accordions.

import Toggle from '@site/static/usage/v8/accordion/toggle/index.md';

<Toggle />

## Listen for Accordion State Changes

:::caution
Most `ionChange` events emitted by other components such as [Input](./input) and [Textarea](./textarea) bubble. As a result, these events will bubble up and cause your `ionChange` listener on the Accordion Group to fire if the associated components are used inside of an Accordion.

When using other components that emit `ionChange` inside of Accordion it is recommended to have the `ionChange` callback on Accordion Group check the `target` key on the event passed to the callback to verify that `ionChange` is coming from the Accordion Group and not any descendants.
:::

Developers can listen for the `ionChange` event to be notified when accordions expand or collapse.

import ListenChanges from '@site/static/usage/v8/accordion/listen-changes/index.md';

<ListenChanges />

## Multiple Accordions

Developers can allow multiple accordions to be open at once with the `multiple` property.

import Multiple from '@site/static/usage/v8/accordion/multiple/index.md';

<Multiple />

## Disabling Accordions

### Individual Accordion

Individual accordions can be disabled with the `disabled` property on `ion-accordion`.

import DisableIndividual from '@site/static/usage/v8/accordion/disable/individual/index.md';

<DisableIndividual />

### Accordion Group

The accordion group can be disabled with the `disabled` property on `ion-accordion-group`.

import DisableGroup from '@site/static/usage/v8/accordion/disable/group/index.md';

<DisableGroup />

## Readonly Accordions

### Individual Accordion

Individual accordions can be disabled with the `readonly` property on `ion-accordion`.

import ReadonlyIndividual from '@site/static/usage/v8/accordion/readonly/individual/index.md';

<ReadonlyIndividual />

### Accordion Group

The accordion group can be disabled with the `readonly` property on `ion-accordion-group`.

import ReadonlyGroup from '@site/static/usage/v8/accordion/readonly/group/index.md';

<ReadonlyGroup />

## Anatomy

### Header

The `header` slot is used as the toggle that will expand or collapse your accordion. We recommend you use an `ion-item` here to take advantage of the accessibility and theming functionalities.

When using `ion-item` in the `header` slot, the `ion-item`'s `button` prop is set to `true` and the `detail` prop is set to `false`. In addition, we will also automatically add a toggle icon to the `ion-item`. This icon will automatically be rotated when you expand or collapse the accordion. See [Customizing Icons](#icons) for more information.

### Content

The `content` slot is used as the part of the accordion that is revealed or hidden depending on the state of your accordion. You can place anything here except for another `ion-content` instance as only one instance of `ion-content` should be added per page.

## Customization

### Expansion Styles

There are two built in expansion styles: `compact` and `inset`. This expansion style is set via the `expand` property on `ion-accordion-group`.

When `expand="inset"`, the accordion group is given a border radius. On `md` mode, the entire accordion will shift down when it is opened.

import ExpansionStyles from '@site/static/usage/v8/accordion/customization/expansion-styles/index.md';

<ExpansionStyles />

### Advanced Expansion Styles

You can customize the expansion behavior by styling based on the accordion's state. There are four state classes applied to `ion-accordion`. Styling using these classes can allow you to create advanced state transitions:

| Class Name | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| `.accordion-expanding` | Applied when the accordion is actively expanding |
| `.accordion-expanded` | Applied when the accordion is fully expanded |
| `.accordion-collapsing` | Applied when the accordion is actively collapsing |
| `.accordion-collapsed` | Applied when the accordion is fully collapsed |

If you need to target specific pieces of the accordion, we recommend targeting the element directly. For example, if you want to customize the ion-item in your header slot when the accordion is expanded, you can use the following selector:

```css
ion-accordion.accordion-expanding ion-item[slot="header"],
ion-accordion.accordion-expanded ion-item[slot="header"] {
  --color: red;
}
```

import AdvancedExpansionStyles from '@site/static/usage/v8/accordion/customization/advanced-expansion-styles/index.md';

<AdvancedExpansionStyles />

### Icons

When using an `ion-item` in the `header` slot, we automatically add an `ion-icon`. The type of icon used can be controlled by the `toggleIcon` property, and the slot it is added to can be controlled with the `toggleIconSlot` property.

If you would like to manage the icon yourself or use an icon that is not an `ion-icon`, you can add the `ion-accordion-toggle-icon` class to the icon element.

Regardless of which option you choose, the icon will automatically be rotated when you expand or collapse the accordion.

import Icons from '@site/static/usage/v8/accordion/customization/icons/index.md';

<Icons />

### Theming

Since `ion-accordion` acts as a shell around the header and content elements, you can easily theme the accordion however you would like. You can theme the header by targeting the slotted `ion-item`. Since you are using `ion-item`, you also have access to all of the [ion-item CSS Variables](./item#css-custom-properties) and [ion-item Shadow Parts](./item#css-shadow-parts). Theming the content is also easily achieved by targeting the element that is in the `content` slot.

import Theming from '@site/static/usage/v8/accordion/customization/theming/index.md';

<Theming />

## Accessibility

### Animations

By default, animations are enabled when expanding or collapsing an accordion item. Animations will be automatically disabled when the `prefers-reduced-motion` media query is supported and set to `reduce`. For browsers that do not support this, animations can be disabled by setting the `animated` config in your Ionic Framework app.

import AccessibilityAnimations from '@site/static/usage/v8/accordion/accessibility/animations/index.md';

<AccessibilityAnimations />

### Keyboard Interactions

When used inside an `ion-accordion-group`, `ion-accordion` has full keyboard support for interacting with the component. The following table details what each key does:

| Key                                  | Description                                                  |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| <kbd>Space</kbd> or <kbd>Enter</kbd> | When focus is on the accordion header, the accordion will collapse or expand depending on the state of the component. |
| <kbd>Tab</kbd>                       | Moves focus to the next focusable element.                   |
| <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Tab</kbd>    | Moves focus to the previous focusable element.               |
| <kbd>Down Arrow</kbd>                | - When focus is on an accordion header, moves focus to the next accordion header.  <br />- When focus is on the last accordion header, moves focus to the first accordion header. |
| <kbd>Up Arrow</kbd>                  | - When focus is on an accordion header, moves focus to the previous accordion header.  <br />- When focus is on the first accordion header, moves focus to the last accordion header. |
| <kbd>Home</kbd>                      | When focus is on an accordion header, moves focus to the first accordion header. |
| <kbd>End</kbd>                       | When focus is on an accordion header, moves focus to the last accordion header. |

## Performance

### Animations

The accordion animation works by knowing the height of the `content` slot when the animation starts. The accordion expects that this height will remain consistent throughout the animation. As a result, developers should avoid performing any operation that may change the height of the content during the animation.

For example, using [ion-img](./img) may cause layout shifts as it lazily loads images. This means that as the animation plays, `ion-img` will load the image data, and the dimensions of  `ion-img` will change to account for the loaded image data. This can result in the height of the `content` slot changing. Developers have a few options for avoiding this:

1. Use an `img` element without any lazy loading. `ion-img` always uses lazy loading, but `img` does not use lazy loading by default. This is the simplest option and works well if you have small images that do not significantly benefit from lazy loading.

2. Set a minimum width and height on `ion-img`. If you need to use lazy loading and know the dimensions of the images ahead of time (such as if you are loading icons of the same size), you can set the `ion-img` to have a minimum width or height using CSS. This gives developers the benefit of lazy loading while avoiding layout shifts. This works when using an `img` element with `loading="lazy"` too!

3. If neither of these options are applicable, developers may want to consider disabling animations altogether by using the `animated` property on [ion-accordion-group](./accordion-group).

</head>

import EncapsulationPill from '@components/page/api/EncapsulationPill';

<EncapsulationPill type="scoped" />


An Action Sheet is a dialog that displays a set of options. It appears on top of the app's content, and must be manually dismissed by the user before they can resume interaction with the app. Destructive options are made obvious in `ios` mode. There are multiple ways to dismiss the action sheet, including tapping the backdrop or hitting the escape key on desktop.

## Inline Action Sheets (Recommended)

`ion-action-sheet` can be used by writing the component directly in your template. This reduces the number of handlers you need to wire up in order to present the Action Sheet.

import Trigger from '@site/static/usage/v8/action-sheet/inline/trigger/index.md';

<Trigger />

### Using `isOpen`

The `isOpen` property on `ion-action-sheet` allows developers to control the presentation state of the Action Sheet from their application state. This means when `isOpen` is set to `true` the Action Sheet will be presented, and when `isOpen` is set to `false` the Action Sheet will be dismissed.

`isOpen` uses a one-way data binding, meaning it will not automatically be set to `false` when the Action Sheet is dismissed. Developers should listen for the `ionActionSheetDidDismiss` or `didDismiss` event and set `isOpen` to `false`. The reason for this is it prevents the internals of `ion-action-sheet` from being tightly coupled with the state of the application. With a one way data binding, the Action Sheet only needs to concern itself with the boolean value that the reactive variable provides. With a two way data binding, the Action Sheet needs to concern itself with both the boolean value as well as the existence of the reactive variable itself. This can lead to non-deterministic behaviors and make applications harder to debug.

import IsOpen from '@site/static/usage/v8/action-sheet/inline/isOpen/index.md';

<IsOpen />

## Controller Action Sheets

The `actionSheetController` can be used in situations where more control is needed over when the Action Sheet is presented and dismissed.

import Controller from '@site/static/usage/v8/action-sheet/controller/index.md';

<Controller />

## Buttons

A button's `role` property can either be `destructive` or `cancel`. Buttons without a role property will have the default look for the platform. Buttons with the `cancel` role will always load as the bottom button, no matter where they are in the array. All other buttons will be displayed in the order they have been added to the `buttons` array. Note: We recommend that `destructive` buttons are always the first button in the array, making them the top button. Additionally, if the action sheet is dismissed by tapping the backdrop, then it will fire the handler from the button with the cancel role.

A button can also be passed data via the `data` property on `ActionSheetButton`. This will populate the `data` field in the return value of the `onDidDismiss` method.

## Collecting Role Information on Dismiss

When the `didDismiss` event is fired, the `data` and `role` fields of the event detail can be used to gather information about how the Action Sheet was dismissed.

import RoleInfo from '@site/static/usage/v8/action-sheet/role-info-on-dismiss/index.md';

<RoleInfo />

## Theming

Action Sheet uses scoped encapsulation, which means it will automatically scope its CSS by appending each of the styles with an additional class at runtime. Overriding scoped selectors in CSS requires a [higher specificity](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Specificity) selector.

### Styling

We recommend passing a custom class to `cssClass` in the `create` method and using that to add custom styles to the host and inner elements. This property can also accept multiple classes separated by spaces.

```css
/* DOES NOT WORK - not specific enough */
.action-sheet-group {
  background: #e5e5e5;
}

/* Works - pass "my-custom-class" in cssClass to increase specificity */
.my-custom-class .action-sheet-group {
  background: #e5e5e5;
}
```

import Styling from '@site/static/usage/v8/action-sheet/theming/styling/index.md';

<Styling />

### CSS Custom Properties

Any of the defined [CSS Custom Properties](#css-custom-properties-1) can be used to style the Action Sheet without needing to target individual elements.

import CssCustomProperties from '@site/static/usage/v8/action-sheet/theming/css-properties/index.md';

<CssCustomProperties />

## Accessibility

### Screen Readers

Action Sheets set aria properties in order to be [accessible](../reference/glossary#a11y) to screen readers, but these properties can be overridden if they aren't descriptive enough or don't align with how the action sheet is being used in an app.

#### Role

Action Sheets are given a `role` of [`dialog`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/dialog_role). In order to align with the ARIA spec, either the `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby` attribute must be set.

#### Action Sheet Description

It is strongly recommended that every Action Sheet have the `header` property defined, as Ionic will automatically set `aria-labelledby` to point to the header element. However, if you choose not to include a `header`, an alternative is to use the `htmlAttributes` property to provide a descriptive `aria-label` or set a custom `aria-labelledby` value.

import EncapsulationPill from '@components/page/api/EncapsulationPill';

<EncapsulationPill type="scoped" />

An Alert is a dialog that presents users with information or collects information from the user using inputs. An alert appears on top of the app's content, and must be manually dismissed by the user before they can resume interaction with the app. It can also optionally have a `header`, `subHeader` and `message`.

## Inline Alerts (Recommended)

`ion-alert` can be used by writing the component directly in your template. This reduces the number of handlers you need to wire up in order to present the Alert.

import Trigger from '@site/static/usage/v8/alert/presenting/trigger/index.md';

<Trigger />

### Using `isOpen`

The `isOpen` property on `ion-alert` allows developers to control the presentation state of the Alert from their application state. This means when `isOpen` is set to `true` the Alert will be presented, and when `isOpen` is set to `false` the Alert will be dismissed.

`isOpen` uses a one-way data binding, meaning it will not automatically be set to `false` when the Alert is dismissed. Developers should listen for the `ionAlertDidDismiss` or `didDismiss` event and set `isOpen` to `false`. The reason for this is it prevents the internals of `ion-alert` from being tightly coupled with the state of the application. With a one way data binding, the Alert only needs to concern itself with the boolean value that the reactive variable provides. With a two way data binding, the Alert needs to concern itself with both the boolean value as well as the existence of the reactive variable itself. This can lead to non-deterministic behaviors and make applications harder to debug.

import IsOpen from '@site/static/usage/v8/alert/presenting/isOpen/index.md';

<IsOpen />

## Controller Alerts

The `alertController` can be used in situations where more control is needed over when the Alert is presented and dismissed.

import Controller from '@site/static/usage/v8/alert/presenting/controller/index.md';

<Controller />

## Buttons

In the array of `buttons`, each button includes properties for its `text`, and optionally a `handler`. If a handler returns `false` then the alert will not automatically be dismissed when the button is clicked. All buttons will show up in the order they have been added to the `buttons` array from left to right. Note: The right most button (the last one in the array) is the main button.

Optionally, a `role` property can be added to a button, such as `cancel`. If a `cancel` role is on one of the buttons, then if the alert is dismissed by tapping the backdrop, then it will fire the handler from the button with a cancel role.

import Buttons from '@site/static/usage/v8/alert/buttons/index.md';

<Buttons />


## Inputs

Alerts can also include several different inputs whose data can be passed back to the app. Inputs can be used as a simple way to prompt users for information. Radios, checkboxes and text inputs are all accepted, but they cannot be mixed. For example, an alert could have all radio button inputs, or all checkbox inputs, but the same alert cannot mix radio and checkbox inputs. Do note however, different types of "text" inputs can be mixed, such as `url`, `email`, `text`, `textarea` etc. If you require a complex form UI which doesn't fit within the guidelines of an alert then we recommend building the form within a modal instead.

### Text Inputs Example

import TextInputs from '@site/static/usage/v8/alert/inputs/text-inputs/index.md';

<TextInputs />

### Radio Example

import Radios from '@site/static/usage/v8/alert/inputs/radios/index.md';

<Radios />

## Customization

Alert uses scoped encapsulation, which means it will automatically scope its CSS by appending each of the styles with an additional class at runtime. Overriding scoped selectors in CSS requires a [higher specificity](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Specificity) selector.

We recommend passing a custom class to `cssClass` in the `create` method and using that to add custom styles to the host and inner elements. This property can also accept multiple classes separated by spaces.

```css
/* DOES NOT WORK - not specific enough */
.alert-wrapper {
  background: #e5e5e5;
}

/* Works - pass "my-custom-class" in cssClass to increase specificity */
.my-custom-class .alert-wrapper {
  background: #e5e5e5;
}
```

Any of the defined [CSS Custom Properties](#css-custom-properties) can be used to style the Alert without needing to target individual elements:

```css
.my-custom-class {
  --background: #e5e5e5;
}
```

import Customization from '@site/static/usage/v8/alert/customization/index.md';

<Customization />

:::note
 If you are building an Ionic Angular app, the styles need to be added to a global stylesheet file.

## Accessibility

### Screen Readers

Alerts set aria properties in order to be [accessible](../reference/glossary#a11y) to screen readers, but these properties can be overridden if they aren't descriptive enough or don't align with how the alert is being used in an app.

#### Role

Ionic automatically sets the Alert's `role` to either [`alertdialog`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/alertdialog_role) if there are any inputs or buttons included, or [`alert`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/alert_role) if there are none.

#### Alert Description

If the `header` property is defined for the Alert, the `aria-labelledby` attribute will be automatically set to the header's ID. The `subHeader` element will be used as a fallback if `header` is not defined. Similarly, the `aria-describedby` attribute will be automatically set to the ID of the `message` element if that property is defined.

It is strongly recommended that your Alert have a `message`, as well as either a `header` or `subHeader`, in order to align with the ARIA spec. If you choose not to include a `header` or `subHeader`, an alternative is to provide a descriptive `aria-label` using the `htmlAttributes` property.

<Tabs groupId="framework" defaultValue="angular" values={[{ value: 'angular', label: 'Angular' }, { value: 'javascript', label: 'Javascript' }, { value: 'react', label: 'React' }, { value: 'vue', label: 'Vue' }]}>

<TabItem value="angular">

```javascript
const alert = await this.alertController.create({
  message: 'This is an alert with custom aria attributes.',
  htmlAttributes: {
    'aria-label': 'alert dialog',
  },
});
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="javascript">

```javascript
const alert = await this.alertController.create({
  message: 'This is an alert with custom aria attributes.',
  htmlAttributes: {
    'aria-label': 'alert dialog',
  },
});
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="react">

```javascript
useIonAlert({
  message: 'This is an alert with custom aria attributes.',
  htmlAttributes: {
    'aria-label': 'alert dialog',
  },
});
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="vue">

```javascript
const alert = await alertController.create({
  message: 'This is an alert with custom aria attributes.',
  htmlAttributes: {
    'aria-label': 'alert dialog',
  },
});
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>


All ARIA attributes can be manually overwritten by defining custom values in the `htmlAttributes` property of the Alert.

#### Alert Buttons Description

Buttons containing text will be read by a screen reader. If a description other than the existing text is desired, a label can be set on the button by passing `aria-label` to the `htmlAttributes` property on the button.

<Tabs groupId="framework" defaultValue="angular" values={[{ value: 'angular', label: 'Angular' }, { value: 'javascript', label: 'Javascript' }, { value: 'react', label: 'React' }, { value: 'vue', label: 'Vue' }]}>

</head>

import EncapsulationPill from '@components/page/api/EncapsulationPill';

App is a container element for an Ionic application. There should only be one `<ion-app>` element per project. An app can have many Ionic components including menus, headers, content, and footers. The overlay components get appended to the `<ion-app>` when they are presented.

Using `ion-app` enables the following behaviors:

* [Keyboard Lifecycle Events](../developing/keyboard#keyboard-lifecycle-events) without the need for any native plugins
* [Hardware Back Button Listeners](../developing/hardware-back-button) for customizing the hardware back button behavior on Android devices
* Status bar support in Capacitor or Cordova which allows users to scroll to the top of the view by tapping the status bar
* Scroll assist utilities which scroll the content so focused text inputs are not covered by the on-screen keyboard
* [Ripple effect](./ripple-effect) when activating buttons on Material Design mode
* Other tap and focus utilities which make the experience of using an Ionic app feel more native

## Programmatic Focus

Ionic offers focus utilities for components with the `ion-focusable` class. These utilities automatically manage focus for components when certain keyboard keys, like <kbd>Tab</kbd>, are pressed. Components can also be programmatically focused in response to user actions using the `setFocus` method from `ion-app`.

Avatars are circular components that usually wrap an image or icon. They can be used to represent a person or an object.

Avatars can be used by themselves or inside of any element. If placed inside of an `ion-chip` or `ion-item`, the avatar will resize to fit the parent component. To position an avatar on the left or right side of an item, set the slot to `start` or `end`, respectively.

The back button navigates back in the app's history when clicked. It is only displayed when there is history in the navigation stack, unless [`defaultHref`](#default-back-history) is set. The back button displays different text and icon based on the mode, but this can be customized.

## Basic Usage

import Basic from '@site/static/usage/v8/back-button/basic/index.md';

<Basic />

## Custom Back Button

By default, the back button will display the text `"Back"` with a `"chevron-back"` icon on `ios`, and an `"arrow-back-sharp"` icon on `md`. This can be customized per back button component by setting the `icon` or `text` properties. Alternatively, it can be set globally using the `backButtonIcon` or `backButtonText` properties in the global config. See the [Config docs](../developing/config) for more information.

import Custom from '@site/static/usage/v8/back-button/custom/index.md';

<Custom />

## Default Back History

Occasionally an app may need to show the back button and navigate back when there is no history. This can be done by setting the `defaultHref` on the back button to a path. In order to use `defaultHref`, the app must contain a router with paths set.

Backdrops are full screen components that overlay other components. They are useful behind components that transition in on top of other content and can be used to dismiss that component.

## Basic Usage

The backdrop prevents clicking or tapping on the content behind it. It is transparent by default, so the below demo includes CSS to make it visible.

import Basic from '@site/static/usage/v8/backdrop/basic/index.md';

<Basic />

## Styling

The backdrop can be customized by assigning CSS properties directly to the backdrop element. Common properties include `background-color`, `background` and `opacity`. 

Content can be displayed above the backdrop by setting a `z-index` on the content, higher than the backdrop (defaults to `2`).

A Breadcrumb is a single navigation item that is a child of the Breadcrumbs component. A breadcrumb can link elsewhere in an app or it can be plain text. Each breadcrumb has a separator between it and the next breadcrumb and can optionally contain an icon.

See the [Breadcrumbs](./breadcrumbs) documentation for more information.

```typescript
interface BreadcrumbCollapsedClickEventDetail {
  collapsedBreadcrumbs?: HTMLIonBreadcrumbElement[];

Breadcrumbs are navigation items that are used to indicate where a user is on an app or site. They should be used for large sites and apps with hierarchically arranged pages. Breadcrumbs can be collapsed based on the maximum number that can show, and the collapsed indicator can be clicked on to present a popover with more information or expand the collapsed breadcrumbs.

## Collapsing Items

### Max Items

If there are more items than the value of `maxItems`, the breadcrumbs will be collapsed. By default, only the first and last items will be shown.

import MaxItems from '@site/static/usage/v8/breadcrumbs/collapsing-items/max-items/index.md';

<MaxItems />

### Items Before or After Collapse

Once the items are collapsed, the number of items to show can be controlled by the `itemsBeforeCollapse` and `itemsAfterCollapse` properties.

import ItemsBeforeAfter from '@site/static/usage/v8/breadcrumbs/collapsing-items/items-before-after/index.md';

<ItemsBeforeAfter />

### Collapsed Indicator Click -- Expand Breadcrumbs

Clicking the collapsed indicator will fire the `ionCollapsedClick` event. This can be used to, for example, expand the breadcrumbs.

import ExpandOnClick from '@site/static/usage/v8/breadcrumbs/collapsing-items/expand-on-click/index.md';

<ExpandOnClick />

### Collapsed Indicator Click -- Present Popover

The `ionCollapsedClick` event can also be used to present an overlay (in this case, an `ion-popover`) showing the hidden breadcrumbs.

Buttons provide a clickable element, which can be used in forms, or anywhere that needs simple, standard button functionality. They may display text, icons, or both. Buttons can be styled with several attributes to look a specific way.

## Basic Usage

import Basic from '@site/static/usage/v8/button/basic/index.md';

<Basic />

## Expand

This property lets you specify how wide the button should be. By default, buttons have `display: inline-block`, but setting this property will change the button to a full-width element with `display: block`.

import Expand from '@site/static/usage/v8/button/expand/index.md';

<Expand />

## Shape

This property lets you specify the shape of the button. By default, buttons are rectangular with a small border radius, but setting this to `"round"` will change the button to a rounded element.

import Shape from '@site/static/usage/v8/button/shape/index.md';

<Shape />


## Fill

This property determines the background and border color of the button. By default, buttons have a solid background unless the button is inside of a toolbar, in which case it has a transparent background.

import Fill from '@site/static/usage/v8/button/fill/index.md';

<Fill />

## Size

This property specifies the size of the button. Setting this property will change the height and padding of a button.

import Size from '@site/static/usage/v8/button/size/index.md';

<Size />

## Icons

<CSSProps />

## Accessibility

Buttons are built to be accessible, but may need some adjustments depending on their content. The button component renders a native [button element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/button) which allows it to take advantage of the functionality that a native button provides.

### Overflowing Text Content

There are many cases where a button's text content may overflow the container. It is recommended to wrap the text inside of the button when this happens so that all of the text can still be read. The button component will automatically adjust its height to accommodate the extra lines of text.

The button text does not automatically wrap to the next line when the text is too long to fit. In order to make the text wrap, the `ion-text-wrap` class can be added, which will set the `white-space` property to `"normal"`. This will become the default in a future major release.

:::info
The `max-width` style is set on the button below for demo purposes only. Text wrapping will work with a dynamic button width.

The Buttons component is a container element. It should be used inside of a [toolbar](./toolbar) and can contain several types of buttons, including standard [buttons](./button), [menu buttons](./menu-button), and [back buttons](./back-button).

## Basic Usage

import Basic from '@site/static/usage/v8/buttons/basic/index.md';

<Basic />


## Buttons Placement

Buttons can be positioned inside of the toolbar using a named slot. The below chart has a description of each slot.

| Slot         | Description                                                                                              |
|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `start`      | Positions to the `left` of the content in LTR, and to the `right` in RTL.                                |
| `end`        | Positions to the `right` of the content in LTR, and to the `left` in RTL.                                |
| `secondary`  | Positions element to the `left` of the content in `ios` mode, and directly to the `right` in `md` mode.  |
| `primary`    | Positions element to the `right` of the content in `ios` mode, and to the far `right` in `md` mode.      |

import Placement from '@site/static/usage/v8/buttons/placement/index.md';

<Placement />


## Types of Buttons

A button in a toolbar is styled to be clear by default, but this can be changed using the [`fill`](./button#fill) property on the button. The properties included on [back button](./back-button) and [menu button](./menu-button) in this example are for display purposes; see their respective documentation for proper usage.

import Types from '@site/static/usage/v8/buttons/types/index.md';

<Types />


## Collapsible Buttons

The `collapse` property can be set on the buttons to collapse them when the header collapses. This is typically used with [collapsible large titles](./title#collapsible-large-titles).

:::info

This feature is only available for iOS.

Cards are containers that display content such as text, images, buttons, and lists.
A card can be a single component, but is often made up of a header, title, subtitle,
and content. Cards are broken up into several components to accommodate this structure:
[card header](./card-header), [card title](./card-title), [card subtitle](./card-subtitle),
and [card content](./card-content).

</head>

import EncapsulationPill from '@components/page/api/EncapsulationPill';

<EncapsulationPill type="shadow" />


Checkboxes allow the selection of multiple options from a set of options. They appear as checked (ticked) when activated. Clicking on a checkbox will toggle the `checked` property. They can also be checked programmatically by setting the `checked` property.

## Basic Usage

import Basic from '@site/static/usage/v8/checkbox/basic/index.md';

<Basic />

## Label Placement

Developers can use the `labelPlacement` property to control how the label is placed relative to the control. This property mirrors the flexbox `flex-direction` property.

import LabelPlacement from '@site/static/usage/v8/checkbox/label-placement/index.md';

<LabelPlacement />

## Alignment

Developers can use the `alignment` property to control how the label and control are aligned on the cross axis. This property mirrors the flexbox `align-items` property.

:::note
Stacked checkboxes can be aligned using the `alignment` property. This can be useful when the label and control need to be centered horizontally.
:::

import Alignment from '@site/static/usage/v8/checkbox/alignment/index.md';

<Alignment />

## Justification

Developers can use the `justify` property to control how the label and control are packed on a line. This property mirrors the flexbox `justify-content` property.

import Justify from '@site/static/usage/v8/checkbox/justify/index.md';

<Justify />


:::note
`ion-item` is only used in the demos to emphasize how `justify` works. It is not needed in order for `justify` to function correctly.
:::

## Indeterminate Checkboxes

import Indeterminate from '@site/static/usage/v8/checkbox/indeterminate/index.md';

<Indeterminate />

## Links inside of Labels

Checkbox labels can sometimes be accompanied with links. These links can provide more information related to the checkbox. However, clicking the link should not check the checkbox. To achieve this, we can use [stopPropagation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event/stopPropagation) to prevent the click event from bubbling. When using this approach, the rest of the label still remains clickable.

import LabelLink from '@site/static/usage/v8/checkbox/label-link/index.md';

<LabelLink />

## Helper & Error Text

Helper and error text can be used inside of a checkbox with the `helperText` and `errorText` property. The error text will not be displayed unless the `ion-invalid` and `ion-touched` classes are added to the `ion-checkbox`. This ensures errors are not shown before the user has a chance to enter data.

In Angular, this is done automatically through form validation. In JavaScript, React and Vue, the class needs to be manually added based on your own validation.

Columns are cellular components of the [grid](./grid) system and go inside of a [row](./row). They will expand to fill the row. All content within a grid should go inside of a column.

See the [grid](./grid) documentation for more information.


## Column Alignment

By default, columns will stretch to fill the entire height of the row. Columns are [flex items](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Flex_Item), so there are several [CSS classes](/docs/layout/css-utilities#flex-item-properties) that can be applied to a column to customize this behavior.

</head>

import EncapsulationPill from '@components/page/api/EncapsulationPill';

<EncapsulationPill type="shadow" />


The content component provides an easy to use content area with some useful methods
to control the scrollable area. There should only be one content in a single
view.

Content, along with many other Ionic components, can be customized to modify its padding, margin, and more using the global styles provided in the [CSS Utilities](/docs/layout/css-utilities) or by individually styling it using CSS and the available [CSS Custom Properties](#css-custom-properties).


## Basic Usage

import Basic from '@site/static/usage/v8/content/basic/index.md';

<Basic />


## Header & Footer

Content can be the only top-level component in a page, or it can be used alongside a [header](./header), [footer](./footer), or both. When used with a header or footer, it will adjust its size to fill the remaining height.

import HeaderFooter from '@site/static/usage/v8/content/header-footer/index.md';

<HeaderFooter />


## Fullscreen Content

By default, content fills the space between a [header](./header) and [footer](./footer) but does not go behind them. In certain cases, it may be desired to have the content scroll behind the header and footer, such as when the `translucent` property is set on either of them, or `opacity` is set on the toolbar. This can be achieved by setting the `fullscreen` property on the content to `true`.

import Fullscreen from '@site/static/usage/v8/content/fullscreen/index.md';

<Fullscreen />


## Fixed Content

To place elements outside of the scrollable area, assign them to the `fixed` slot. Doing so will [absolutely position](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/position#absolute_positioning) the element to the top left of the content. In order to change the position of the element, it can be styled using the [top, right, bottom, and left](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/position) CSS properties.

The `fixedSlotPlacement` property is used to determine if content in the `fixed` slot is placed before or after the main content in the DOM. When set to `before`, fixed slot content will be placed before the main content and will therefore receive keyboard focus before the main content receives keyboard focus. This can be useful when the main content contains an infinitely-scrolling list, preventing a [FAB](./fab) or other fixed content from being reachable by pressing the tab key.

import Fixed from '@site/static/usage/v8/content/fixed/index.md';

<Fixed />

## Scroll Methods

Content provides [methods](#methods) that can be called to scroll the content to the bottom, top, or to a specific point. They can be passed a `duration` in order to smoothly transition instead of instantly changing the position.

import ScrollMethods from '@site/static/usage/v8/content/scroll-methods/index.md';

<ScrollMethods />

## Scroll Events

Scroll events are disabled by default for content due to performance. However, they can be enabled by setting `scrollEvents` to `true`. This is necessary before listening to any of the scroll [events](#events).

import ScrollEvents from '@site/static/usage/v8/content/scroll-events/index.md';

<ScrollEvents />

### CSS Custom Properties

<CSSProps />

### Safe Area Padding

The content component will not automatically apply padding to any of its sides to account for the [safe area](/docs/theming/advanced#safe-area-padding). This is because the content component is often used in conjunction with other components that apply their own padding, such as [headers](./header) and [footers](./footer). However, if the content component is being used on its own, it may be desired to apply padding to the safe area. This can be done through CSS by using the `--ion-safe-area-(dir)` variables described in [Application Variables](../theming/advanced.md#application-variables).

The most common use case for this is to apply padding to the top of the content to account for the status bar. This can be done by setting the `padding-top` property to the value of the `--ion-safe-area-top` variable.

```css
ion-content::part(scroll) {
  padding-top: var(--ion-safe-area-top, 0);
}
```

Another common use case is to apply padding to the left side of the content to account for the notch when the device is in landscape mode and the notch is on the left side. This can be done by setting the `padding-left` property to the value of the `--ion-safe-area-left` variable.

```css
ion-content::part(scroll) {
  padding-left: var(--ion-safe-area-left, 0);
}
```

import SafeArea from '@site/static/usage/v8/content/theming/safe-area/index.md';

<SafeArea />

## Interfaces

```

### ScrollDetail

```typescript

  scrollLeft: number;
}
```

### ScrollBaseCustomEvent

While not required, this interface can be used in place of the `CustomEvent` interface for stronger typing on the `ionScrollStart` and `ionScrollEnd` events.

```typescript
interface ScrollBaseCustomEvent extends CustomEvent {
  detail: ScrollBaseDetail;
  target: HTMLIonContentElement;
}
```

### ScrollCustomEvent

While not required, this interface can be used in place of the `CustomEvent` interface for stronger typing on the `ionScroll` event.

```typescript
interface ScrollCustomEvent extends ScrollBaseCustomEvent {
  detail: ScrollDetail;
}
```

</head>

import EncapsulationPill from '@components/page/api/EncapsulationPill';

<EncapsulationPill type="shadow" />

Datetime Button links with a [Datetime](./datetime) component to display the formatted date and time. It also provides buttons to present the datetime in a modal, popover, and more.

## Overview

Datetime Button should be used when space is constrained. This component displays buttons which show the current date and time values. When the buttons are tapped, the date or time pickers open in the overlay.

When using Datetime Button with a JavaScript framework such as Angular, React, or Vue be sure to use the [keepContentsMounted property on ion-modal](./modal#keepcontentsmounted) or the [keepContentsMounted property on ion-popover](./popover#keepcontentsmounted). This allows the linked datetime instance to be mounted even if the overlay has not been presented yet.

## Basic Usage

import Basic from '@site/static/usage/v8/datetime-button/basic/index.md';

<Basic />

## Localization

The localized text on `ion-datetime-button` is determined by the `locale` property on the associated `ion-datetime` instance. See [Datetime Localization](./datetime#localization) for more details.

## Format Options

You can customize the format of the date and time in a Datetime Button by providing `formatOptions` on the associated Datetime instance. See [Datetime Format Options](./datetime#format-options) for more details.

import FormatOptions from '@site/static/usage/v8/datetime-button/format-options/index.md';

<FormatOptions />

## Usage with Modals and Popovers

`ion-datetime-button` must be associated with a mounted `ion-datetime` instance. As a result, [Inline Modals](./modal#inline-modals-recommended) and [Inline Popovers](./popover#inline-popovers) with the `keepContentsMounted` property set to `true` must be used.

  <title>ion-datetime: Ionic API Input for Datetime Format Picker</title>
  <meta name="description" content="Datetimes present a picker interface to select dates and times. Ionic's API Datetime input component easily displays a preferred format, and manages values." />
</head>

import EncapsulationPill from '@components/page/api/EncapsulationPill';

<EncapsulationPill type="shadow" />

Datetimes present a calendar interface and time wheel, making it easy for users to select dates and times. Datetimes are similar to the native `input` elements of `datetime-local`, however, Ionic Framework's Datetime component makes it easy to display the date and time in the preferred format, and manage the datetime values.

## Overview

Historically, handling datetime values within JavaScript, or even within HTML
inputs, has always been a challenge. Specifically, JavaScript's `Date` object is
notoriously difficult to correctly parse apart datetime strings or to format
datetime values. Even worse is how different browsers and JavaScript versions
parse various datetime strings differently, especially per locale.

Fortunately, Ionic Framework's datetime input has been designed so developers can avoid
the common pitfalls, allowing developers to easily manipulate datetime values and give the user a simple datetime picker for a great user experience.

### ISO 8601 Datetime Format: `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mmZ`

Ionic Framework uses the [ISO 8601 datetime format](https://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime)
for its value. The value is simply a string, rather than using JavaScript's
`Date` object. Using the ISO datetime format makes it easy to serialize
and parse within JSON objects and databases.

Below are some examples of ISO 8601 formats that can be used with `ion-datetime`:

| Description          | Format                   | Datetime Value Example          |
| -------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------  |
| Year                 | `YYYY`                   | `1994`                          |
| Year and Month       | `YYYY-MM`                | `1994-12`                       |
| Complete Date        | `YYYY-MM-DD`             | `1994-12-15`                    |
| Date and Time        | `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm`       | `1994-12-15T13:47`              |
| UTC Timezone         | `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ`   | `1994-12-15T13:47:20Z`          |
| Timezone Offset      | `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssTZD` | `1994-12-15T13:47:20+05:00`     |
| Hour and Minute      | `HH:mm`                  | `13:47`                         |

Note that the year is always four-digits, milliseconds (if it's added) is always
three-digits, and all others are always two-digits. So the number representing
January always has a leading zero, such as `01`. Additionally, the hour is
always in the 24-hour format, so `00` is `12am` on a 12-hour clock, `13` means
`1pm`, and `23` means `11pm`.

:::note
While seconds, milliseconds, and time zone can be specified using the ISO 8601 datetime format, `ion-datetime` does not provide an interface for second, millisecond, and time zone selection. Any second, millisecond, or time zone values provided will be ignored.
:::

## Basic Usage

<Basic />

## Usage with Datetime Button

If you need to present a datetime in an overlay such as a modal or a popover, we recommend using [ion-datetime-button](./datetime-button). `ion-datetime-button` should be used when space is constrained. This component displays buttons which show the current date and time values. When the buttons are tapped, the date or time pickers open in the overlay.

## Setting Values Asynchronously

If its `value` is updated programmatically after a datetime has already been created, the datetime will automatically jump to the new date. However, it is recommended to avoid updating the `value` in this way when users are able to interact with the datetime, as this could be disorienting for those currently trying to select a date. For example, if a datetime's `value` is loaded by an asynchronous process, it is recommended to hide the datetime with CSS until the value has finished updating.

## Date Constraints

### Max and Min Dates

To customize the minimum and maximum datetime values, the `min` and `max` component properties can be provided which may make more sense for the app's use-case. Following the same IS0 8601 format listed in the table above, each component can restrict which dates can be selected by the user.

The following example restricts date selection to March 2022 through May 2022 only.

<MaxMin />

### Selecting Specific Values

While the `min` and `max` properties allow you to restrict date selection to a certain range, the `monthValues`, `dayValues`, `yearValues`, `hourValues`, and `minuteValues` properties allow you choose specific days and times that users can select.

The following example allows minutes to be selected in increments of 15. It also allows for days to be selected in increments of 5.

<Values />

### Advanced Date Constraints

With the `isDateEnabled` property, developers can customize the `ion-datetime` to disable a specific day, range of dates, weekends or any custom rule using an ISO 8601 date string.
The `isDateEnabled` property accepts a function returning a boolean, indicating if a date is enabled. The function is called for each rendered calendar day, for the previous, current and next month. Custom implementations should be optimized for performance to avoid jank.

The following example shows how to disable all weekend dates. For more advanced date manipulation, we recommend using a date utility such as `date-fns`.

<Advanced />

## Localization

Ionic Framework makes use of the [Intl.DatetimeFormat](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/DatetimeFormat) Web API which allows us to automatically localize the month and day names according to the language and region set on the user's device.

### Custom Locale

For instances where you need a specific locale, you can use the `locale` property to set it. The locale controls both the language and the date and time formats that are displayed.

The following example shows how to set the locale to Spanish (Spain).

<CustomLocale />

:::note
The time label is not automatically localized. See [Time Label](#time-label) for more information.
:::

### Hour Cycle

`ion-datetime` will use the hour cycle that is specified by the `locale` property by default. For example, if `locale` is set to `en-US`, then `ion-datetime` will use a 12 hour cycle.

There are 4 primary hour cycle types:

| Hour cycle type | Description                                                  |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `'h12'`          | Hour system using 1–12; corresponds to 'h' in patterns. The 12 hour clock, with midnight starting at 12:00 am. |
| `'h23'`         | Hour system using 0–23; corresponds to 'H' in patterns. The 24 hour clock, with midnight starting at 0:00. |
| `'h11'`         | Hour system using 0–11; corresponds to 'K' in patterns. The 12 hour clock, with midnight starting at 0:00 am. |
| `'h24'`         | Hour system using 1–24; corresponds to 'k' in pattern. The 24 hour clock, with midnight starting at 24:00. |

:::note
  Source: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/Locale/hourCycle
:::


There may be scenarios where you need to have more control over which hour cycle is used. This is where the `hourCycle` property can help.

In the following example, we can use the `hourCycle` property to force `ion-datetime` to use the 12 hour cycle even though the locale is `en-GB`, which uses a 24 hour cycle by default:

<HourCycle />

### First Day of the Week

For `ion-datetime`, the default first day of the week is Sunday. As of 2022, there is no browser API that lets Ionic automatically determine the first day of the week based on a device's locale, though there is on-going work regarding this (see: [TC39 GitHub](https://github.com/tc39/ecma402/issues/6)).

<FirstDayOfWeek />

### Time Label

The time label is not automatically localized. Fortunately, Ionic makes it easy to provide custom localizations with the `time-label` slot.

<TimeLabel />

### Locale Extension Tags

`ion-datetime` also supports [locale extension tags](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/Locale) as part of the `Intl.Locale` API. These tags let you encode information about the locale in the locale string itself. Developers may prefer to use the extension tag approach if they are using the [Intl.Locale API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/Locale) in their apps.

For example, if you wanted to use a 12 hour cycle with the `en-GB` locale, you could provide extension tags instead of using both the `locale` and `hourCycle` properties:

<LocaleExtensionTags />

:::note
Be sure to check the [Browser Compatibility Chart](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/Locale#browser_compatibility)  for `Intl.Locale` before using it in your app.
:::

## Presentation

By default, `ion-datetime` allows users to select both date and time. In addition, users have access to selecting the specific month, year, hour, and minute.

Some use cases may call for only date selection or only time selection. The `presentation` property allows you to specify which pickers to show and the order to show them in. For example, setting `date-time` will have the calendar picker appear before the time picker. Setting `time-date` will have the calendar picker appear after the time picker.

### Month and Year Selection

Month and year selection is available by passing `month-year`, `month`, or `year` to the `presentation` property.

This example shows a datetime with the `month-year` configuration.

<MonthAndYear />

### Time Selection

Time selection is available by passing `date-time`, `time-date`, or `time` to the `presentation` property.

This example shows a datetime with the `time` configuration.

<Time />

### Date Selection

Date selection is available by passing `date-time`, `time-date`, or `date` to the `presentation` property.

This example shows a datetime with the `date` configuration.

<Date />

### Wheel Style Pickers

By default, Ionic will prefer to show a grid style layout when using `presentation`. However, it is possible to show a wheel style using the `preferWheel` property. When `preferWheel` is `true`, Ionic will prefer to show the wheel style layout when possible.

Certain `presentation` options have both grid and wheel styles that developers can choose from with the `preferWheel` property. Other `presentation` values only have a wheel style and will never show a grid style. The table below shows which `presentation` values have grid or wheel styles.

| `presentation` | Has Grid Style? | Has Wheel Style? |
| -------------- | --------------- | ---------------- |
| `date`         | Yes             | Yes              |
| `date-time`    | Yes             | Yes              |
| `month`        | No              | Yes              |
| `month-year`   | No              | Yes              |
| `time`         | No              | Yes              |
| `time-date`    | Yes             | Yes              |
| `year`         | No              | Yes              |

The example below shows the wheel picker with `presentation="date-time"`.

import Wheel from '@site/static/usage/v8/datetime/presentation/wheel/index.md';

<Wheel />

## Show Adjacent Days

If the `showAdjacentDays` property is set to `true`, days from the previous and next month will be displayed in the calendar view to fill any empty spaces at the beginning or end of the month. When a user clicks on an enabled adjacent day, the calendar will smoothly animate to show that month's view.

The calendar view always displays 6 rows when `showAdjacentDays` is enabled, so days from the previous or next month will be shown as needed to fill the grid. For example, even if a month starts on the first day of the week and ends within the fifth row, days from the next month will appear at the end to complete the sixth row.

:::note
This property is only supported when using `presentation="date"` and `preferWheel="false"`.
:::

<ShowAdjacentDays />

## Multiple Date Selection

If the `multiple` property is set to `true`, multiple dates can be selected from the calendar picker. Clicking a selected date will deselect it.

:::note
This property is only supported when using `presentation="date"` and `preferWheel="false"`.
:::

<MultipleDateSelection />

## Titles

By default, `ion-datetime` does not show any header or title associated with the component. Developers can use the `showDefaultTitle` property to show the default title/header configuration. They can also use the `title` slot to customize what is rendered in the header.

### Showing the Default Title

<ShowingDefaultTitle />

### Customizing the Title

<CustomizingTitle />

## Format Options

You can customize the format of the date in the header text and the time in the time button of a Datetime component by providing `formatOptions`. The `date` and `time` in the `formatOptions` property should each be an [`Intl.DateTimeFormatOptions`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/DateTimeFormat/DateTimeFormat#options) object. If `formatOptions` is not provided, default formats will be used for dates and times.

Datetime [does not manipulate or set](#time-zones) the time zone. If `timeZone` or `timeZoneName` are provided, they will be ignored, and the time zone will be set to UTC. This ensures that the displayed value matches the selected value, rather than being converted to the user's current time zone.

Be careful with the options you provide, as they may not match the selected presentation. For example, providing `minute: 'numeric'` for a presentation of `month` may lead to unexpected behavior, displaying a month where only a time might be expected.

<FormatOptions />

## Buttons

By default, `ionChange` is emitted with the new datetime value whenever a new date is selected. To require user confirmation before emitting `ionChange`, you can either set the `showDefaultButtons` property to `true` or use the `buttons` slot to pass in a custom confirmation button. When passing in custom buttons, the confirm button must call the `confirm` method on `ion-datetime` for `ionChange` to be emitted.

### Showing Confirmation Buttons

The default Done and Cancel buttons are already preconfigured to call the [`confirm`](#confirm) and [`cancel`](#cancel) methods, respectively.

<ShowingConfirmationButtons />

### Customizing Button Texts

For simple use cases, developers can provide custom button text to the confirmation and cancel values through the `doneText` and `cancelText` properties. We recommend doing this when you only need to change the button text and do not need any custom behavior.

<CustomizingButtonTexts />

### Customizing Button Elements

Developers can provide their own buttons for advanced custom behavior.

`ion-datetime` has `confirm`, `cancel`, and `reset` methods that developers can call when clicking on custom buttons. The `reset` method also allows developers to provide a date to reset the datetime to.

<CustomizingButtons />

## Highlighting Specific Dates

Using the `highlightedDates` property, developers can style particular dates with custom text or background colors. This property can be defined as either an array of dates and their colors, or a callback that receives an ISO string and returns the colors to use.

When specifying colors, any valid CSS color format can be used. This includes hex codes, `rgba`, [color variables](../theming/colors), etc.

To maintain a consistent user experience, the style of selected date(s) will always override custom highlights.

:::note
This property is only supported when `preferWheel="false"`, and using a `presentation` of either `"date"`, `"date-time"`, or `"time-date"`.
:::

### Using Array

An array is better when the highlights apply to fixed dates, such as due dates.

<HighlightedDatesArray />

### Using Callback

A callback is better when the highlighted dates are recurring, such as birthdays or recurring meetings.

<HighlightedDatesCallback />

## Styling

### Global Theming

Ionic's powerful theming system can be used to easily change your entire app to match a certain theme. In this example, we used the [Color Creator](../theming/colors#new-color-creator) and the [Stepped Color Generator](../theming/themes#stepped-color-generator) to create a rose color palette that we can use for `ion-datetime`.

The benefit of this approach is that every component, not just `ion-datetime`, can automatically take advantage of this theme.

<GlobalTheming />

### Calendar Days

The calendar days in a grid-style `ion-datetime` can be styled using CSS shadow parts.

:::note
The example below selects the day 2 days ago, unless that day is in the previous month, then it selects a day 2 days in the future. This is done for demo purposes in order to show how to apply custom styling to all days, the current day, and the selected day.
:::

<CalendarDaysStyling />

### Wheel Pickers

The wheels used in `ion-datetime` can be styled through a combination of shadow parts and CSS variables. This applies to both the columns in wheel-style datetimes, and the month/year picker in grid-style datetimes.

<WheelStyling />

## Time Zones

Ionic's `ion-datetime` follows the [datetime-local](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/datetime-local) behavior of not manipulating or setting the time zone inside of a datetime control. In other words, a time value of "07:00" will not be adjusted according to different time zones.

We recommend using a library such as [date-fns-tz](https://github.com/marnusw/date-fns-tz) to convert a datetime value to the desired time zone.

Below is an example of formatting an ISO-8601 string to display in the time zone set on a user's device:

```typescript
import { format, utcToZonedTime } from 'date-fns-tz';

// Get the time zone set on the user's device
const userTimeZone = Intl.DateTimeFormat().resolvedOptions().timeZone;

// Create a date object from a UTC date string
const date = new Date('2014-10-25T10:46:20Z');

// Use date-fns-tz to convert from UTC to a zoned time
const zonedTime = utcToZonedTime(date, userTimeZone);

// Create a formatted string from the zoned time
format(zonedTime, 'yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ssXXX', { timeZone: userTimeZone });
```

### Parsing Date Values

The `ionChange` event will emit the date value as an ISO-8601 string in the event payload. It is the developer's responsibility to format it based on their application needs. We recommend using [date-fns](https://date-fns.org) to format the date value.

Below is an example of formatting an ISO-8601 string to display the month, date and year:

```typescript
import { format, parseISO } from 'date-fns';

/**
 * This is provided in the event
 * payload from the `ionChange` event.
 *
 * The value is an ISO-8601 date string.
 */
const dateFromIonDatetime = '2021-06-04T14:23:00-04:00';
const formattedString = format(parseISO(dateFromIonDatetime), 'MMM d, yyyy');

console.log(formattedString); // Jun 4, 2021
```

See https://date-fns.org/docs/format for a list of all the valid format tokens.


## Advanced Datetime Validation and Manipulation

The datetime picker provides the simplicity of selecting an exact format, and
persists the datetime values as a string using the standardized [ISO 8601
datetime format](https://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime). However, it's important
to note that `ion-datetime` does not attempt to solve all situations when
validating and manipulating datetime values. If datetime values need to be
parsed from a certain format, or manipulated (such as adding 5 days to a date,
subtracting 30 minutes, etc.), or even formatting data to a specific locale,
then we highly recommend using [date-fns](https://date-fns.org) to work with
dates in JavaScript.

## Accessibility

### Keyboard Interactions

`ion-datetime` has full keyboard support for navigating between focusable elements inside of the component. The following table details what each key does:

| Key                                  | Description                                    |
| ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| <kbd>Tab</kbd>                       | Moves focus to the next focusable element.     |
| <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Tab</kbd>    | Moves focus to the previous focusable element. |
| <kbd>Space</kbd> or <kbd>Enter</kbd> | Clicks the focusable element.                  |

#### Date Grid

| Key                                    | Description                                       |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| <kbd>ArrowUp</kbd>                     | Moves focus to the same day of the previous week. |
| <kbd>ArrowDown</kbd>                   | Moves focus to the same day of the next week.     |
| <kbd>ArrowRight</kbd>                  | Moves focus to the next day.                      |
| <kbd>ArrowLeft</kbd>                   | Moves focus to the previous day.                  |
| <kbd>Home</kbd>                        | Moves focus to the first day of the current week. |
| <kbd>End</kbd>                         | Moves focus to the last day of the current week.  |
| <kbd>PageUp</kbd>                      | Changes the grid of dates to the previous month.  |
| <kbd>PageDown</kbd>                    | Changes the grid of dates to the next month.      |
| <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>PageUp</kbd>   | Changes the grid of dates to the previous year.   |
| <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>PageDown</kbd> | Changes the grid of dates to the next year.       |

#### Time, Month, and Year Wheels

The wheel picker in Datetime uses [Picker](./picker) internally. See [Picker Accessibility](./picker#accessibility) for more information on accessibility features with the wheel picker.

## Interfaces

### DatetimeChangeEventDetail

```typescript
interface DatetimeChangeEventDetail {
  value?: string | null;
}
```

### DatetimeCustomEvent

While not required, this interface can be used in place of the `CustomEvent` interface for stronger typing with Ionic events emitted from this component.

```typescript
interface DatetimeCustomEvent extends CustomEvent {
  detail: DatetimeChangeEventDetail;
  target: HTMLIonDatetimeElement;
}
```

Floating Action Buttons (FABs) represent the primary action in an application. By default, they have a circular shape. When pressed, the button may open more related actions.

As the name suggests, FABs generally float over the content in a fixed position. This is achieved by wrapping the fab button in a [fab](./fab) component. If the button is not wrapped with a fab, it will scroll with the content.

For usage examples, see the [fab documentation](./fab).

The fab list component is a container for multiple [fab buttons](./fab-button). It contains actions related to the main fab button and is flung out on click. To specify what side the buttons should appear on, set the `side` property to `"start"`, `"end"`, `"top"`, or `"bottom"`.

For usage examples, see the [fab documentation](./fab).

  <title>ion-fab: Ionic Floating Action Button for Android and iOS</title>
  <meta name="description" content="Fabs, floating action buttons, are container elements that contain one or more fab buttons. Use ion-fab when creating Android and iOS apps with Ionic Framework." />
</head>

import EncapsulationPill from '@components/page/api/EncapsulationPill';

<EncapsulationPill type="shadow" />

Fabs are container elements that contain one or more [fab buttons](./fab-button). They should be placed in a fixed position that does not scroll with the content. Fabs should have one main fab button. Fabs can also contain one or more [fab lists](./fab-list) which contain related buttons that show when the main fab button is clicked.

## Basic Usage

import BasicUsage from '@site/static/usage/v8/fab/basic/index.md';

<BasicUsage />

## List Side

The `side` property of the [fab list](./fab-list) component controls where it appears relative to the main fab button. A single fab can have multiple fab lists as long as they all have different values for `side`.

import ListSide from '@site/static/usage/v8/fab/list-side/index.md';

<ListSide />

## Positioning

In order to place the fab in a fixed position, it should be assigned to the `fixed` slot of the outer [content](./content) component. Use the `vertical` and `horizontal` props to control the alignment of the fab in the viewport. The `edge` prop will cause the fab button to overlap with the app's header or footer.

import Positioning from '@site/static/usage/v8/fab/positioning/index.md';

<Positioning />

### Safe Area

If there is no `ion-header` or `ion-footer` component, the fab may be covered by a device's notch, status bar, or other device UI. In these cases, the [safe area](/docs/theming/advanced#safe-area-padding) on the top and bottom is not taken into account. This can be adjusted by using the [`--ion-safe-area-(dir)` variables](/docs/theming/advanced#application-variables).

When using a fab with `vertical` set to `"top"` without an `ion-header`, the top margin needs to be set:

```css
ion-fab {
  margin-top: var(--ion-safe-area-top, 0);
}
```

And when using a fab with `vertical` set to `"bottom"` without an `ion-footer`, the bottom margin needs to be set:

```css
ion-fab {
  margin-bottom: var(--ion-safe-area-bottom, 0);
}
```

If there is an `ion-header` (for a fab with `vertical` set to `"top"`) or `ion-footer` (for a fab with `vertical` set to `"bottom"`), no CSS adjustment is needed because the fab gets positioned relative to the header or footer.

import SafeArea from '@site/static/usage/v8/fab/safe-area/index.md';

<SafeArea />

### Relative to Infinite List

In scenarios where a view contains many interactive elements, such as an infinitely-scrolling list, it may be challenging for users to navigate to the Floating Action Button (FAB) if it is placed below all the items in the DOM.

By setting the `fixedSlotPlacement` property on [Content](./content) to `before`, the FAB will be placed before the main content in the DOM. This ensures that the FAB receives keyboard focus before other interactive elements receive focus, making it easier for users to access the FAB.

import BeforeContent from '@site/static/usage/v8/fab/before-content/index.md';

<BeforeContent />

## Button Sizing

Setting the `size` property of the main fab button to `"small"` will render it at a mini size. Note that this property will not have an effect when used with the inner fab buttons.

import ButtonSizing from '@site/static/usage/v8/fab/button-sizing/index.md';

<ButtonSizing />

## Accessibility

### Labels

Since FABs are allowed to contain only icons, developers must provide an `aria-label` on each `ion-fab-button` instance. Without this label, assistive technologies will not be able to announce the purpose of each button.

  <meta name="description" content="A footer is a root component that sits at the bottom of a page. Ionic footers can be a wrapper for ion-toolbar to make sure the content area is sized correctly." />
</head>

import EncapsulationPill from '@components/page/api/EncapsulationPill';


Footer is a root component of a page that aligns itself to the bottom of the page. It is recommended to be used as a wrapper for one or more [toolbars](./toolbar), but it can be used to wrap any element. When a toolbar is used inside of a footer, the content will be adjusted so it is sized correctly, and the footer will account for any device safe areas.

## Basic Usage

import Basic from '@site/static/usage/v8/footer/basic/index.md';

<Basic />


## Translucent Footer

Footers can match the transparency found in native iOS applications by setting the `translucent` property. In order to see the content scrolling behind the footer, the `fullscreen` property needs to be set on the content. This effect will only apply when the mode is `"ios"` and the device supports [backdrop-filter](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/backdrop-filter#browser_compatibility).

import Translucent from '@site/static/usage/v8/footer/translucent/index.md';

<Translucent />


## Fade Footer

Many native iOS applications have a fade effect on the toolbar. This can be achieved by setting the `collapse` property on the footer to `"fade"`. When the content is scrolled to the end, the background and border on the footer will fade away. This effect will only apply when the mode is `"ios"`.

import Fade from '@site/static/usage/v8/footer/fade/index.md';

<Fade />


### Usage with Virtual Scroll

A fade footer requires a scroll container to work properly. When using a virtual scrolling solution, a custom scroll target needs to be provided. Scrolling on the content needs to be disabled and the `.ion-content-scroll-host` class needs to be added to the element responsible for scrolling.

import CustomScrollTarget from '@site/static/usage/v8/footer/custom-scroll-target/index.md';

<CustomScrollTarget />

## Borders

In `"md"` mode, the footer will have a `box-shadow` on the top. In `"ios"` mode, it will receive a `border` on the top. These can be removed by adding the `.ion-no-border` class to the footer.

import NoBorder from '@site/static/usage/v8/footer/no-border/index.md';

<NoBorder />

  <title>ion-grid: Display Grids for Mobile-First Custom App Layout</title>
  <meta name="description" content="Ion-Grid is a mobile-first flexbox system to build custom application display layouts with a 12 column layout and different breakpoints based on screen size." />
</head>

import EncapsulationPill from '@components/page/api/EncapsulationPill';

<EncapsulationPill type="shadow" />


The grid is a powerful mobile-first flexbox system for building custom layouts. It is composed of three units — a grid, [row(s)](row.md) and [column(s)](col.md). Columns will expand to fill the row, and will resize to fit additional columns. It is based on a 12 column layout with different breakpoints based on the screen size. The number of columns can be customized using CSS.

## Overview

- Grids act as a container for all rows and columns. Grids take up the full width of their container,
  but adding the `fixed` property will set the width based on the screen size, see [Fixed Grid](#fixed-grid) below.
- Rows are horizontal groups of columns that line the columns up properly.
- Content should be placed within columns, and only columns may be immediate children of rows.
- The `size` property indicates the number of columns to use out of the default 12 per row.
  So, `size="4"` can be added to a column in order to take up 1/3 of the grid, or 4 of the 12 columns.
- Columns without a value for size will automatically have equal widths. For example, four columns will each automatically be 25% wide.
- Column widths are set as a percentage, so they’re always fluid and sized relative to their parent element.
- There is padding between individual columns. However, the padding can be removed from the grid and
  columns by adding the `ion-no-padding` class to the grid. See the [CSS Utilities](../layout/css-utilities) for more styles that can be applied to the grid.
- There are five grid tiers, one for each responsive breakpoint: all breakpoints (extra small), small, medium, large, and extra large.
- Grid tiers are based on minimum widths, meaning they apply to their tier and all those larger than them
  (e.g., `size-sm="4"` applies to small, medium, large, and extra large devices).
- Grids can be customized via CSS variables. See [Customizing the Grid](#customizing-the-grid).

## Default Breakpoints

The default breakpoints for the grid and the corresponding properties are defined in the table below. Breakpoint values can not be customized at this time. For more information on why they can't be customized, see [Variables in Media Queries](../theming/advanced#variables-in-media-queries).

| Name | Value  | Width Property | Offset Property | Push Property | Pull Property | Description                          |
| ---- | ------ | -------------- | --------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| xs   | 0      | `size`         | `offset`        | `push`        | `pull`        | Set columns when (min-width: 0)      |
| sm   | 576px  | `sizeSm`       | `offsetSm`      | `pushSm`      | `pullSm`      | Set columns when (min-width: 576px)  |
| md   | 768px  | `sizeMd`       | `offsetMd`      | `pushMd`      | `pullMd`      | Set columns when (min-width: 768px)  |
| lg   | 992px  | `sizeLg`       | `offsetLg`      | `pushLg`      | `pullLg`      | Set columns when (min-width: 992px)  |
| xl   | 1200px | `sizeXl`       | `offsetXl`      | `pushXl`      | `pullXl`      | Set columns when (min-width: 1200px) |


## Basic Usage

By default, columns will take up equal width inside of a row for all devices and screen sizes.

import Basic from '@site/static/usage/v8/grid/basic/index.md';

<Basic />


## Fixed Grid

Grids take up 100% width of their container. By adding the `fixed` property to the grid, the width will be set based on the screen size. The width of the grid for each breakpoint is listed in the table below, but it can be customized. For more information, see [Customizing the Grid](#customizing-the-grid). Open the below example in StackBlitz and resize the screen to see the grid width change.

| Name | Value  | Description                                       |
| ---- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| xs   | 100%   | Width is 100% for xs screens                      |
| sm   | 540px  | Set grid width to 540px when (min-width: 576px)   |
| md   | 720px  | Set grid width to 720px when (min-width: 768px)   |
| lg   | 960px  | Set grid width to 960px when (min-width: 992px)   |
| xl   | 1140px | Set grid width to 1140px when (min-width: 1200px) |

import Fixed from '@site/static/usage/v8/grid/fixed/index.md';

<Fixed />


## Column Size

Columns can be set to specific sizes to take up a certain number out of the total number of columns, or resize their width based on the content. The default number of columns is 12, but this can be customized. See the [Number of Columns](#number-of-columns) section below for more information.

### Content-based size

By setting the `size` to `"auto"` the column can size itself based on the natural width of its content. This is necessary when setting a column to an absolute width, such as a specific number of pixels. The columns next to the auto-width column will resize to fill the row.

import SizeAuto from '@site/static/usage/v8/grid/size-auto/index.md';

<SizeAuto />


### Specified size

Set the `size` of a column and the others will automatically resize around it. If a size is specified on all of the columns and it doesn't add up to the total number of columns, there will be empty space after the columns.

import Size from '@site/static/usage/v8/grid/size/index.md';

<Size />

### Responsive size

The `size` property will change the column width for all [breakpoints](#default-breakpoints). Column also provides several size properties with the breakpoint name appended to the end of "size". These properties can be used to change the width of the column based on the screen size. Open the below example in StackBlitz and resize the screen to see the column widths change.

import SizeResponsive from '@site/static/usage/v8/grid/size-responsive/index.md';

<SizeResponsive />


## Column Offset

Columns can be offset to shift to the right by a certain number of columns out of the total number of columns.

### Specified offset

Columns can be moved to the right by using the `offset` property. This property increases the left margin of the column by the number of specified columns. It also shifts the columns to the right of it, if any exist.

import Offset from '@site/static/usage/v8/grid/offset/index.md';

<Offset />

### Responsive offset

The `offset` property will change the column's left margin for all [breakpoints](#default-breakpoints). Column also provides several offset properties with the breakpoint name appended to the end of "offset". These properties can be used to change the offset of the column based on the screen size. Open the below example in StackBlitz and resize the screen to see the column offsets change.

import OffsetResponsive from '@site/static/usage/v8/grid/offset-responsive/index.md';

<OffsetResponsive />


## Column Push & Pull

Columns can be pushed to to the right or pulled to the left by a certain number of columns out of the total number of columns.

### Specified push & pull

Reorder the columns by adding the `push` and `pull` properties. These properties adjust the `left` and `right` of the columns by the specified number of columns making it easy to reorder columns. This will cause columns to overlap if they are shifted to where another column is positioned.

import PushPull from '@site/static/usage/v8/grid/push-pull/index.md';

<PushPull />

### Responsive push & pull

The `push` and `pull` properties will change the column's position for all [breakpoints](#default-breakpoints). Column also provides several `push` and `pull` properties with the breakpoint name appended to the end of "push" / "pull". These properties can be used to change the position of the column based on the screen size. Open the below example in StackBlitz and resize the screen to see the column positions change.

import PushPullResponsive from '@site/static/usage/v8/grid/push-pull-responsive/index.md';

<PushPullResponsive />

## Alignment

### Vertical Alignment

All columns can be vertically aligned inside of a row by adding different classes to the row. For a list of available classes, see [css utilities](/layout/css-utilities#flex-container-properties).

import VerticalAlignment from '@site/static/usage/v8/grid/vertical-alignment/index.md';

<VerticalAlignment />


### Horizontal Alignment

All columns can be horizontally aligned inside of a row by adding different classes to the row. For a list of available classes, see [css utilities](/layout/css-utilities.md#flex-container-properties).

import HorizontalAlignment from '@site/static/usage/v8/grid/horizontal-alignment/index.md';

<HorizontalAlignment />

## Customizing the Grid

Using our built-in CSS variables, it’s possible to customize the predefined grid attributes. Change the values of the padding, the number of columns, and more.

### Fixed Width

The width of a fixed grid can be set for all breakpoints with the `--ion-grid-width` CSS variable. To override individual breakpoints, use the `--ion-grid-width-{breakpoint}` CSS variables. The default value for each of the breakpoints can be found in the [Fixed Grid](#fixed-grid) section. Open the below example in StackBlitz and resize the screen to see the grid width change.

import Width from '@site/static/usage/v8/grid/customizing/width/index.md';

<Width />

### Number of Columns

The number of grid columns can be modified with the `--ion-grid-columns` CSS variable. By default there are 12 grid columns, but this can be changed to any positive integer and be used to calculate the width of each individual column.

import ColumnNumber from '@site/static/usage/v8/grid/customizing/column-number/index.md';

<ColumnNumber />

### Padding

The padding on the grid container can be set for all breakpoints with the `--ion-grid-padding` CSS variable. To override individual breakpoints, use the `--ion-grid-padding-{breakpoint}` CSS variables.

The padding on the columns can be set for all breakpoints with the `--ion-grid-column-padding` CSS variable. To override individual breakpoints, use the `--ion-grid-column-padding-{breakpoint}` CSS variables.

import Padding from '@site/static/usage/v8/grid/customizing/padding/index.md';

import EncapsulationPill from '@components/page/api/EncapsulationPill';


Header is a root component of a page that aligns itself to the top of the page. It is recommended to be used as a wrapper for one or more [toolbars](./toolbar), but it can be used to wrap any element. When a toolbar is used inside of a header, the content will be adjusted so it is sized correctly, and the header will account for any device safe areas.


## Basic Usage

import Basic from '@site/static/usage/v8/header/basic/index.md';

<Basic />


## Translucent Header

Headers can match the transparency found in native iOS applications by setting the `translucent` property. In order to see the content scrolling behind the header, the `fullscreen` property needs to be set on the content. This effect will only apply when the mode is `"ios"` and the device supports [backdrop-filter](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/backdrop-filter#browser_compatibility).

import Translucent from '@site/static/usage/v8/header/translucent/index.md';

<Translucent />


## Condensed Header

Ionic provides the functionality found in native iOS applications to show a large toolbar title and then collapse it to a small title when scrolling. This can be done by adding two headers, one above the content and one inside of the content, and then setting the `collapse` property to `"condense"` on the header inside of the content. This effect will only apply when the mode is "ios".

import Condense from '@site/static/usage/v8/header/condense/index.md';

<Condense />


## Fade Header

Many native iOS applications have a fade effect on the toolbar. This can be achieved by setting the `collapse` property on the header to `"fade"`. When the page is first loaded, the background and border on the header will be hidden. As the content is scrolled, the header will fade back in. This effect will only apply when the mode is "ios".

This functionality can be combined with a [Condensed Header](#condensed-header) as well. The `collapse` property with a value set to `"fade"` should be on the header outside of the content.

import Fade from '@site/static/usage/v8/header/fade/index.md';

<Fade />


### Usage with Virtual Scroll

A fade header requires a scroll container to work properly. When using a virtual scrolling solution, a custom scroll target needs to be provided. Scrolling on the content needs to be disabled and the `.ion-content-scroll-host` class needs to be added to the element responsible for scrolling.

import CustomScrollTarget from '@site/static/usage/v8/header/custom-scroll-target/index.md';

<CustomScrollTarget />


## Borders

In `"md"` mode, the header will have a `box-shadow` on the bottom. In `"ios"` mode, it will receive a `border` on the bottom. These can be removed by adding the `.ion-no-border` class to the header.

import NoBorder from '@site/static/usage/v8/header/no-border/index.md';

  <meta
    name="description"
    content="Ion-icon is a component for displaying premium designed icons with support for SVG and web font."
  />
</head>

Icon is a simple component made available through the <a href="https://ionic.io/ionicons">Ionicons</a> library, which comes pre-packaged by default with all Ionic Framework applications. It can be used to display any icon from the Ionicons set, or a custom SVG. It also has support for styling such as size and color.

For a list of all available icons, see <a href="https://ionic.io/ionicons">ionic.io/ionicons</a>. For more information including styling and custom SVG usage, see <a href="https://ionic.io/ionicons/usage">the Usage page</a>.

## Basic Usage

import Basic from '@site/static/usage/v8/icon/basic/index.md';

<Basic />


## Accessibility

Icons that are purely decorative content should have <code>aria-hidden="true"</code>. This will not visually hide the icon, but it will hide the element from assistive technology.

```html
<ion-icon name="heart" aria-hidden="true"></ion-icon>
```


If the icon is interactive, it should have alternate text defined by adding an <code>aria-label</code>.

```html
<ion-icon name="heart" aria-label="Favorite"></ion-icon>
```

Alternatively, if the icon is inside of another element that it is describing, that element should have the <code>aria-label</code> added to it, and the icon should be hidden using <code>aria-hidden</code>.

```html
<ion-button aria-label="Favorite">
  <ion-icon name="heart" aria-hidden="true"></ion-icon>
</ion-button>

The `ion-infinite-scroll-content` component is the default child used by the `ion-infinite-scroll`. It displays an infinite scroll spinner that looks best based on the platform and changes the look depending on the infinite scroll's state. The default spinner can be changed and text can be added by setting the `loadingSpinner` and `loadingText` properties.

For more information as well as usage, see the [Infinite Scroll Documentation](./infinite-scroll.md#infinite-scroll-content).

import EncapsulationPill from '@components/page/api/EncapsulationPill';


The Infinite Scroll component calls an action to be performed when the user scrolls a specified distance from the bottom or top of the page.

The expression assigned to the `ionInfinite` event is called when the user reaches that defined distance. When this expression has finished any and all tasks, it should call the `complete()` method on the infinite scroll instance.

## Basic Usage

import Basic from '@site/static/usage/v8/infinite-scroll/basic/index.md';

<Basic />

## Loading Text and Spinner

The `ion-infinite-scroll-content` is responsible for the visual display of the infinite scroll interaction. By default this component changes its look depending on the infinite scroll's state. It displays a spinner that looks best based on the platform the user is on. Both the spinner and loading text can be customized by setting properties on the `ion-infinite-scroll-content` component.

import InfiniteScrollContent from '@site/static/usage/v8/infinite-scroll/infinite-scroll-content/index.md';

<InfiniteScrollContent />

## Custom Content

Separating the `ion-infinite-scroll` and `ion-infinite-scroll-content` components allows developers to create their own content components, if desired. This content can contain anything, from an SVG element to elements with unique CSS animations.

import CustomContent from '@site/static/usage/v8/infinite-scroll/custom-infinite-scroll-content/index.md';

<CustomContent />

## Usage with Virtual Scroll

Infinite scroll requires a scroll container. When using a virtual scrolling solution, you will need to disable scrolling on the `ion-content` and indicate which element container is responsible for the scroll container with the `.ion-content-scroll-host` class target.

```html
<ion-content scroll-y="false">
  <virtual-scroll-element class="ion-content-scroll-host">
    <!-- Your virtual scroll content -->
  </virtual-scroll-element>
  <ion-infinite-scroll>
    <ion-infinite-scroll-content></ion-infinite-scroll-content>
  </ion-infinite-scroll>
</ion-content>
```

:::note

`virtual-scroll-element` refers to the scroll container responsible for scrolling the content. This may be a component provided directly by the virtual scroll solution you are using.

:::

## Accessibility

Developers should assign the `role="feed"` attribute to the scrollable list of items that are added to or removed from as the user scrolls.

Individual list items should either have `role="article"` or use the `<article>` element directly.

For example, when rendering a collection of items in an `ion-list`:

```html
<ion-content role="feed">
  <ion-list>
    <ion-item role="article">
      First item
    </ion-item>
    <ion-item role="article">
      Second item
    </ion-item>
    ...
  </ion-list>

  <ion-infinite-scroll>
    <ion-infinite-scroll-content></ion-infinite-scroll-content>
  </ion-infinite-scroll>
</ion-content>
```

Please refer to the [ARIA: feed role](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/feed_role) documentation for additional information.

## Interfaces

### InfiniteScrollCustomEvent

While not required, this interface can be used in place of the `CustomEvent` interface for stronger typing with Ionic events emitted from this component.

  <title>ion-input-otp: One-Time Password Input Component</title>
  <meta name="description" content="ion-input-otp is a component for entering one-time passwords (OTP) with support for multiple input boxes and automatic focus management." />
</head>

import EncapsulationPill from '@components/page/api/EncapsulationPill';

<EncapsulationPill type="scoped" />

The Input OTP component is a specialized input component designed for entering one-time passwords (OTP). It provides a user-friendly interface for entering verification codes with support for multiple input boxes and automatic focus management.

## Basic Usage

The component provides 4 input boxes by default, which is a common length for many verification codes. The number of input boxes can be customized using the `length` property.

import Basic from '@site/static/usage/v8/input-otp/basic/index.md';

<Basic />

## Type

The `type` property determines the input format, supporting either numeric or alphanumeric verification codes. It accepts two values: `number` and `text`. It uses `type="number"` by default for entering numeric verification codes. When `type="text"` is specified, it accepts alphanumeric input. This flexibility allows handling different OTP formats, whether numeric-only codes (like SMS verification codes) or alphanumeric codes (like backup codes or recovery keys).

The `type` property automatically sets both the `inputmode` and `pattern` attributes:
- When `type="number"`:
  - Sets `inputmode="numeric"` to show a numeric keyboard on mobile devices
  - Sets `pattern="[\p{N}]"` to allow only numeric input
- When `type="text"`:
  - Sets `inputmode="text"` to show a standard keyboard
  - Sets `pattern="[\p{L}\p{N}]"` to allow alphanumeric input

See the [Pattern](#pattern) section for more details on pattern validation and customization.

import Type from '@site/static/usage/v8/input-otp/type/index.md';

<Type />

## Shape

The `shape` property controls the border radius of the input boxes, creating rounded or sharp corners.

import Shape from '@site/static/usage/v8/input-otp/shape/index.md';

<Shape />

## Fill

The `fill` property controls the background style of the input boxes, offering bordered or filled backgrounds.

import Fill from '@site/static/usage/v8/input-otp/fill/index.md';

<Fill />

## Size

The `size` property provides different size options for the input boxes.

import Size from '@site/static/usage/v8/input-otp/size/index.md';

<Size />

## Separators

The `separators` property adds visual dividers between one or more of the input boxes. Separators can be defined in three ways:
- Comma-separated string of numbers (e.g., `"1,3"`)
- Array of numbers (e.g., `[1, 3]`)
- String `"all"` to show separators between every input box

The numbers represent the index after which a separator should appear. For example, `"1,3"` displays a separator after the first and third input box. This can be used to create visually distinct groupings of input boxes, but it will still have one value.

import Separators from '@site/static/usage/v8/input-otp/separators/index.md';

<Separators />

## States

The component supports various states for automatic styling of input boxes:
- `disabled` and `readonly` states via respective properties
- Form validation states: `valid` and `invalid` visually indicated through CSS classes
- In Angular: validation states are automatically managed through the framework's value accessors and form validation
- For other frameworks: developers must manually add `ion-valid`, `ion-invalid`, and `ion-touched` classes
- `ion-invalid` styles only display when touched (`ion-touched`)
- `ion-valid` styles only display when focused (`has-focus`)

import States from '@site/static/usage/v8/input-otp/states/index.md';

<States />

## Pattern

The `pattern` property enables custom validation using regular expressions. It accepts a [string regular expression](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_expressions/Cheatsheet) or [unicode regular expression](https://www.regular-expressions.info/unicode.html) to validate allowed characters. The `pattern` must match the entire value, not just a subset. Default patterns:
- `type="number"`: `"[\p{N}]"` for matching any kind of numeric character in any script.
- `type="text"`: `"[\p{L}\p{N}]"` for any kind of numeric character in any script and any kind of letter from any language.

The component will prevent users from entering any characters that don't match the specified pattern. Developers can override these defaults by providing their own pattern string to match specific input requirements.

:::tip
When using a custom `pattern`, remember that the `type` property controls which keyboard appears on mobile devices:
- Use `type="number"` for numeric-only patterns to show the numeric keyboard
- Use `type="text"` for patterns that include letters to show the alphanumeric keyboard
:::

import Pattern from '@site/static/usage/v8/input-otp/pattern/index.md';

<Pattern />

## Theming

### Colors

The `color` property changes the color palette for input boxes. For `outline` fills, this property changes the caret color, highlight color and border color. For `solid` fills, this property changes the caret color and highlight color.

:::note
The `color` property does *not* change the text color of the input OTP. For that, use the [`--color` CSS property](#css-custom-properties-1).
:::

import Colors from '@site/static/usage/v8/input-otp/theming/colors/index.md';

<Colors />

### CSS Custom Properties

Input OTP uses scoped encapsulation, which means it will automatically scope its CSS by appending each of the styles with an additional class at runtime. Overriding scoped selectors in CSS requires a [higher specificity](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Specificity) selector. Targeting the `ion-input-otp` for customization will not work; therefore we recommend adding a class and customizing it that way. Due to certain styles being applied based on the `fill`, you may need to override properties on the fills separately.

import CSSProps from '@site/static/usage/v8/input-otp/theming/css-properties/index.md';

<CSSProps />

## Accessibility

### Keyboard Interactions

The keyboard navigation for Input OTP follows the [ARIA Authoring Practices Guide](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/practices/keyboard-interface/)'s recommendations for composite widgets. It is treated as a composite widget because it contains multiple focusable elements (input boxes) that function as a single control.

These keyboard interactions apply to all `ion-input-otp` elements when the component is not disabled.

| Key | Description |
| --- | --- |
| <kbd>Tab</kbd> | When first tabbing into the component, focus moves to the first empty box. If all boxes are filled, focus moves to the last box. Once inside the component, tabbing moves to the next focusable element on the page. |
| <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Tab</kbd> | When tabbing backwards into the component, focus moves to the first empty box. If all boxes are filled, focus moves to the last box. Once inside the component, shift tabbing focus moves to the previous focusable element on the page. |
| <kbd>ArrowRight</kbd> | Moves focus to the next input box, stopping at the first empty box. In RTL mode, moves focus back to any previous box that contains a value. |
| <kbd>ArrowLeft</kbd> | Moves focus back to any previous box that contains a value. In RTL mode, moves focus to the next input box, stopping at the first empty box. |
| Any character matching the `pattern` property | Fills the current box and automatically moves focus to the next empty box. If all boxes are filled, focus remains on the last box. If the current box has a value, override the value with the entered character. In RTL mode, input fills boxes from right to left. |
| <kbd>Backspace</kbd> | In an empty box: moves focus back one box and clears its value. <br/> In a box with a value: clears that value. <br/> With values in boxes to the right: shifts them all one position to the left. In RTL mode, with values in boxes to the left: shifts them all one position to the right. |
| <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>V</kbd> <br/> <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>V</kbd> | Pastes content starting from the first box, regardless of which box is currently focused. All existing values are cleared before pasting. For example, if you have "1234" in all boxes and paste "56", the result will be "56" in the first two boxes with the remaining boxes empty. If the pasted content is longer than the available boxes, the extra characters are ignored. |

import EncapsulationPill from '@components/page/api/EncapsulationPill';

<EncapsulationPill type="scoped" />


The input component is a wrapper to the HTML input element with custom styling and additional functionality. It accepts most of the same properties as the HTML input and integrates with the keyboard on mobile devices.


## Basic Usage

import Basic from '@site/static/usage/v8/input/basic/index.md';

<Basic />


## Types

The input component is meant for text type inputs only, such as `"text"`, `"password"`, `"email"`, `"number"`, `"search"`, `"tel"`, and `"url"`. It supports all standard text input events including `keyup`, `keydown`, `keypress`, and more. The default `type` is `"text"`.

import Types from '@site/static/usage/v8/input/types/index.md';

<Types />

## Labels

Labels should be used to describe the input. They can be used visually, and they will also be read out by screen readers when the user is focused on the input. This makes it easy for the user to understand the intent of the input. Input has several ways to assign a label:

- `label` property: used for plaintext labels
- `label` slot: used for custom HTML labels (experimental)
- `aria-label`: used to provide a label for screen readers but adds no visible label

### Label Placement

Labels will take up the width of their content by default. Developers can use the `labelPlacement` property to control how the label is placed relative to the control.

import LabelPlacement from '@site/static/usage/v8/input/label-placement/index.md';

<LabelPlacement />

### Label Slot (experimental)

While plaintext labels should be passed in via the `label` property, if custom HTML is needed, it can be passed through the `label` slot instead.

Note that this feature is considered experimental because it relies on a simulated version of [Web Component slots](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components/Using_templates_and_slots). As a result, the simulated behavior may not exactly match the native slot behavior.

import LabelSlot from '@site/static/usage/v8/input/label-slot/index.md';

<LabelSlot />

### No Visible Label

If no visible label is needed, developers should still supply an `aria-label` so the input is accessible to screen readers.

import NoVisibleLabel from '@site/static/usage/v8/input/no-visible-label/index.md';

<NoVisibleLabel />

## Clear Options

Inputs offer two options for clearing the input based on how you interact with it. The first way is by adding the `clearInput` property which will show a clear button when the input has a `value`. The second way is the `clearOnEdit` property which will clear the input after it has been blurred and then typed in again. Inputs with a `type` set to `"password"` will have `clearOnEdit` enabled by default.

import Clear from '@site/static/usage/v8/input/clear/index.md';

<Clear />


## Filled Inputs

Material Design offers filled styles for an input. The `fill` property on the input can be set to either `"solid"` or `"outline"`.

Filled inputs can be used on iOS by setting the input's `mode` to `md`.

:::warning
Inputs that use `fill` should not be used in an `ion-item` due to styling conflicts between the components.
:::

import Fill from '@site/static/usage/v8/input/fill/index.md';

<Fill />


## Helper & Error Text

Helper and error text can be used inside of an input with the `helperText` and `errorText` property. The error text will not be displayed unless the `ion-invalid` and `ion-touched` classes are added to the `ion-input`. This ensures errors are not shown before the user has a chance to enter data.

In Angular, this is done automatically through form validation. In JavaScript, React and Vue, the class needs to be manually added based on your own validation.

import HelperError from '@site/static/usage/v8/input/helper-error/index.md';

<HelperError />

## Input Counter

The input counter is text that displays under an input to notify the user of how many characters have been entered out of the total that the input will accept. When adding counter, the default behavior is to format the value that gets displayed as `inputLength` / `maxLength`. This behavior can be customized by passing in a formatter function to the `counterFormatter` property.

The `counter` and `counterFormatter` properties on `ion-item` were [deprecated in Ionic 7](/docs/api/input#using-the-modern-syntax) and should be used directly on `ion-input` instead.

import Counter from '@site/static/usage/v8/input/counter/index.md';

<Counter />

Inputs with a counter add a border between the input and the counter, therefore they should not be placed inside of an `ion-item` which adds an additional border under the item. The `ion-padding-start` class can be added to align the counter inputs with inputs inside of items.

import CounterAlignment from '@site/static/usage/v8/input/counter-alignment/index.md';

<CounterAlignment />

## Filtering User Input

Developers can use the `ionInput` event to update the input value in response to user input such as a `keypress`. This is useful for filtering out invalid or unwanted characters.

When storing the value in a state variable, we recommend updating both the state variable and the `ion-input` component value. This ensures that the state variable and the `ion-input` component value remain in sync.

import FilteringData from '@site/static/usage/v8/input/filtering/index.md';

<FilteringData />

## Input Masking

Input masks are expressions that constrain input to support valid input values. Ionic recommends using [Maskito](https://maskito.dev) for input masking. Maskito is a lightweight, dependency-free library for masking input fields. It supports a wide range of masks, including phone numbers, credit cards, dates, and more.

To get started with Maskito, install the library:

```bash
npm install @maskito/core @maskito/{angular,react,vue}
```

import Masking from '@site/static/usage/v8/input/mask/index.md';

<Masking />

:::note

Please submit bug reports with Maskito to the [Maskito Github repository](https://github.com/taiga-family/maskito/issues). For technical support, please use the [Ionic Forum](https://forum.ionicframework.com/) or [Ionic Discord](http://chat.ionicframework.com/).

:::

## Start and End Slots (experimental)

The `start` and `end` slots can be used to place icons, buttons, or prefix/suffix text on either side of the input.

Note that this feature is considered experimental because it relies on a simulated version of [Web Component slots](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components/Using_templates_and_slots). As a result, the simulated behavior may not exactly match the native slot behavior.

:::note
In most cases, [Icon](./icon.md) components placed in these slots should have `aria-hidden="true"`. See the [Icon accessibility docs](https://ionicframework.com/docs/api/icon#accessibility) for more information.

If slot content is meant to be interacted with, it should be wrapped in an interactive element such as a [Button](./button.md). This ensures that the content can be tabbed to.
:::

import StartEndSlots from '@site/static/usage/v8/input/start-end-slots/index.md';

<StartEndSlots />

## Theming

### Colors

Setting the `color` property changes the color palette for each input. On `ios` mode, this property changes the caret color. On `md` mode, this property changes the caret color and the highlight/underline color.

:::note
The `color` property does *not* change the text color of the input. For that, use the [`--color` CSS property](#css-custom-properties-1).
:::

import Colors from '@site/static/usage/v8/input/theming/colors/index.md';

<Colors />

### CSS Custom Properties

Input uses scoped encapsulation, which means it will automatically scope its CSS by appending each of the styles with an additional class at runtime. Overriding scoped selectors in CSS requires a [higher specificity](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Specificity) selector. Targeting the `ion-input` for customization will not work; therefore we recommend adding a class and customizing it that way.

import CSSProps from '@site/static/usage/v8/input/theming/css-properties/index.md';

<CSSProps />

## Interfaces

### InputChangeEventDetail

```typescript
interface InputChangeEventDetail {
  value: string | undefined | null;
}
```

### InputCustomEvent

While not required, this interface can be used in place of the `CustomEvent` interface for stronger typing with Ionic events emitted from this component.

```typescript
interface InputCustomEvent extends CustomEvent {
  detail: InputChangeEventDetail;
  target: HTMLIonInputElement;
}
```

  <meta name="description" content="ion-item-sliding component contains items that are dragged to reveal buttons. Options are revealed when the sliding item is swiped from left to right." />
</head>

import EncapsulationPill from '@components/page/api/EncapsulationPill';


A sliding item contains an item that can be dragged to reveal option buttons. It requires an [item](./item) component as a child. All options to reveal should be placed in the [item options](./item-options) element.


## Basic Usage

Sliding item options are placed on the `"end"` side of the item by default. This means that options are revealed when the item is swiped from end to start, i.e. from right to left in LTR, but from left to right in RTL. To place them on the opposite side, so that they are revealed when swiping in the opposite direction, set the side attribute to `"start"` on the [item options](./item-options) element. Up to two item options can be used at the same time in order to reveal two different sets of options depending on the swiping direction.

import Basic from '@site/static/usage/v8/item-sliding/basic/index.md';

<Basic />


## Icon Options

When an icon is placed alongside text in the [item option](./item-option), it will display the icon on top of the text by default. The slot on the icon can be changed to any of the available [item option slots](./item-option#slots) to change its position.

import Icons from '@site/static/usage/v8/item-sliding/icons/index.md';

<Icons />


## Expandable Options

Options can be expanded to take up the full width of the parent `ion-item` if you swipe past a certain point. This can be combined with the `ionSwipe` event on the [item options](./item-options) to call a method when the item is fully swiped.

import Expandable from '@site/static/usage/v8/item-sliding/expandable/index.md';

<Expandable />


## Interfaces

### ItemSlidingCustomEvent

While not required, this interface can be used in place of the `CustomEvent` interface for stronger typing with Ionic events emitted from this component.

```typescript
interface ItemSlidingCustomEvent extends CustomEvent {
  target: HTMLIonItemSlidingElement;
}
```

Items are elements that can contain text, icons, avatars, images, inputs, and any other native or custom elements. Items should only be used as rows in a [List](./list) with other items. Items can be swiped, deleted, reordered, edited, and more.


## Basic Usage

Items left align text and wrap when the text is wider than the item. We can modify this behavior using the CSS Utilities provided by Ionic Framework, such as using `.ion-text-nowrap` in the below example. See the [CSS Utilities Documentation](/docs/layout/css-utilities) for more classes that can be added to an item to transform the text.

import Basic from '@site/static/usage/v8/item/basic/index.md';

<Basic />


## Content Types

While items in a list take many forms, they typically support 5 different content types: supporting visuals, text, metadata, actions, and controls. However, not all of these content types should be used together at the same time. The following guide shows the different content types as well as how to properly utilize them in an application.

### Supporting Visuals

Supporting visuals are decorative icons or other adornments for an item. Common examples of supporting visuals are [Avatars](./avatar), [Icons](./icon), and [Thumbnails](./thumbnail). Since this content is not required to understand the intent of the item, it is typically hidden from screen readers using `aria-hidden="true"`.

If a visual is required to interact with the item, such as an icon button, then the visual is an [action](#actions) not a supporting visual.

<BestPracticeFigure
  text="Supporting visuals should be rendered in a consistent manner. This makes the information in each item easier to parse."
  doText="Align visuals on the same side in a list"
  doNotText="Don't render visuals with different alignments in the same list"
  doImage={<img alt="A list with several items. Each item has an icon and visible text describing the item. The icon in each item is rendered at the start of the line." src={useBaseUrl('img/item/visuals-do.jpg')} />}
  doNotImage={<img alt="A list with several items. Each item has an icon and visible text describing the item. Some icons are rendered at the start of the line, and some icons are rendered at the end of the line" src={useBaseUrl('img/item/visuals-do-not.jpg')} />}
/>

In the example below, we are creating two lists with supporting visuals. The first list uses icons, and the second list uses avatars. The visuals are decorative, so they all have `aria-hidden="true"`. Additionally, they are presented consistently in the `start` slot.

import SupportingVisuals from '@site/static/usage/v8/item/content-types/supporting-visuals/index.md';

<SupportingVisuals />

### Text

The text content type includes form control labels or other visible text. This text serves to indicate the intent of the item. Try to keep the text short and to the point.

<BestPracticeFigure
  text={<>If you find that you need a few more sentences to clarify the item's purpose, consider moving the additional sentences to a <a href={useBaseUrl('api/note')}>Note</a> at the bottom of the list. Adding the item to its own list makes it clear which item the text is associated with.</>}
  doText="Move long text outside of the list"
  doNotText="Don't try to fit long text in an item"
  doImage={<img alt="A list with an item that contains a checked checkbox indicating the user wants to receive emails. Text describing how often the user will receive emails as well as how to unsubscribe from emails is placed underneath the list." src={useBaseUrl('img/item/long-text-do.jpg')} />}
  doNotImage={<img alt="A list with an item that contains a checked checkbox indicating the user wants to receive emails. Text describing how often the user will receive emails as well as how to unsubscribe from emails is placed as a single paragraph inline with the checkbox, making the text hard to read and increasing the height of the item." src={useBaseUrl('img/item/long-text-do-not.jpg')} />}
/>

In the example below, we are creating a list with different types of text. The "First Name" and "Last Name" labels serve to indicate what to type into the text inputs.

The "Allow Notifications" label on the toggle has additional text underneath it that notes users can disable notifications. Since this text is short, it is placed inside of the item.

Below that list is another list containing a textarea with a [Note](./note) containing long text underneath. The textarea was placed in its own list to make it apparent that the long text is associated with the textarea and not any other fields.

import Text from '@site/static/usage/v8/item/content-types/text/index.md';

<Text />

### Metadata

Metadata provides additional context for an item such as status text or counts. Components like [Badge](./badge) or [Note](./note) are great ways of showing metadata.

<BestPracticeFigure
  text="Limit the amount of metadata you include to only the most relevant information."
  doText="Add only the most important metadata"
  doNotText="Don't add too much metadata as it can overwhelm or confuse the user."
  doImage={<img alt="A list that contains several items, each representing a different to-do list. A count of how many tasks in each to-do list is placed at the end of each item." src={useBaseUrl('img/item/metadata-relevant-do.jpg')} />}
  doNotImage={<img alt="A list that contains several items, each representing a different to-do list. Two counts are placed at the end of each item: One count that states the total number of tasks, and another count that states the total number of tasks that are due today." src={useBaseUrl('img/item/metadata-relevant-do-not.jpg')} />}
/>

<BestPracticeFigure
  text="Developers should also consider how important the metadata is. Drawing attention to the metadata may be helpful for the user or it may distract them from the more important information depending on the use case."
  doText="Prioritize the most important content."
  cautionText="Prioritized metadata may distract from other important content."
  doImage={<img alt="A list that contains several items, each representing a different to-do list. A count of how many tasks in each to-do list is placed at the end of each item." src={useBaseUrl('img/item/metadata-relevant-do.jpg')} />}
  cautionImage={<img alt="A list that contains several items, each representing a different to-do list. A count of how many tasks in each to-do list is placed at the end of each item. However, the count is highlighted in blue which draws the user's attention away from the name of the to-do list." src={useBaseUrl('img/item/metadata-important-caution.jpg')} />}
/>

In the example below, we are creating two lists with different kinds of metadata. The first list uses [Note](./note) to show how many tasks are in each to-do list.

The second list mimics the iOS Mail app to show an inbox. This list makes use of custom metadata including an "unread message" indicator in the "start" slot as well as a timestamp and custom detail icon in the "end" slot. The "unread message" indicator is highlighted in blue to draw the user's attention to the unread messages, while the timestamp is more subtle.

import Metadata from '@site/static/usage/v8/item/content-types/metadata/index.md';

<Metadata />

### Actions

Actions are interactive elements that do something when you activate them. An item can have multiple actions displayed on a line. However, developers should ensure that each action's tap target is large enough to be usable.

Developers should avoid creating <a href="https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/4.4/nested-interactive">nested interactives</a> which can break the user experience with screen readers. For example, developers should avoid adding a button inside the main content of the Item if the `button` property is set to `true`.

<BestPracticeFigure
  text={<>Actions can be added by using the <a href={useBaseUrl('api/item-sliding')}>Item Sliding</a> component. Actions can also be placed directly inside of the Item without the use of Item Sliding, but this should be limited to no more than 2 actions.</>}
  doText={<>Use an <a href={useBaseUrl('api/item-sliding')}>Item Sliding</a> to reveal multiple actions by swiping on the Item.</>}
  doNotText="Don't put more than 2 actions within an Item."
  doImage={<img alt="A list that contains several items, each representing a contact. Each item has text that states the contact's name as well as several actions including pinning the contact, sharing the contact, and deleting the contact. These actions are revealed by swiping on the item." src={useBaseUrl('img/item/actions-do.jpg')} />}
  doNotImage={<img alt="A list that contains several items, each representing a contact. Each item has text that states the contact's name as well as several actions including pinning the contact, sharing the contact, and deleting the contact. The actions are placed directly on the item. Since there are so many actions, some of the text is cut off." src={useBaseUrl('img/item/actions-do-not.jpg')} />}
/>

In the example below, we are creating a list of contacts. Each item is a stubbed button intended to bring you to the full contact page for that item. There are additional actions associated with each item that users can reveal by swiping on the item.

import Actions from '@site/static/usage/v8/item/content-types/actions/index.md';

<Actions />

### Controls

Controls are form components such as checkboxes, inputs, radios, and more. Each item in a list should have at most two controls due to screen space constraints.

<BestPracticeFigure
  text={<>Metadata such as helper text or character counts should not be used on form controls in list views. If such metadata is needed, the form control should be placed outside of a list. <a href={useBaseUrl('api/input#filled-inputs')}>Filled Inputs</a> are a great way of visually defining the input container outside of a list.</>}
  doText="Place inputs with metadata outside of the list."
  doNotText="Don't put metadata for inputs in the list."
  doImage={<img alt="There is an email input and a password input. Both have helper text associated with them. Since both are placed outside of a list it is clear which input each helper text is associated with." src={useBaseUrl('img/item/controls-metadata-list-do.jpg')} />}
  doNotImage={<img alt="There is a list containing an email input and a password input. Both have helper texts associated with them. However, the divider between each item and between the helper text makes it hard to tell which input each helper text is associated with." src={useBaseUrl('img/item/controls-metadata-list-do-not.jpg')} />}
/>

<BestPracticeFigure
  text={<>Alternatively, the metadata can be placed in a <a href={useBaseUrl('api/note')}>Note</a> at the bottom of the list.</>}
  doText="Place metadata for inputs at the end of a list."
  doNotText="Don't put metadata for inputs in the list."
  doImage={<img alt="There are two lists of inputs. The first list contains a password input. Below that list contains text that says 'Password must be at least 16 characters'. The second list contains an email input. This second list is separated so the password length requirement text is clearly associated with the password input above." src={useBaseUrl('img/item/controls-metadata-do.jpg')} />}
  doNotImage={<img alt="There is one list of inputs. One of the inputs is a password input with text below the input that says 'Password must be at least 16 characters'. However, this text is placed directly above another input, so it's not immediately clear which input the text is associated with." src={useBaseUrl('img/item/controls-metadata-do-not.jpg')} />}
/>

<BestPracticeFigure
  text={<>Items should typically have no more than two controls. If you need more controls, consider adding the additional controls in a <a href="useBaseUrl('api/modal')">Modal</a> that is accessible from the item.</>}
  doText="Move additional controls to a submenu accessible from the item."
  doNotText="Don't use more than two controls within an item."
  doImage={<img alt="There is one list of inputs. One of the inputs is a password input with text below the input that says 'Password must be at least 16 characters'. However, this text is placed directly above another input, so it's not immediately clear which input the text is associated with." src={useBaseUrl('img/item/controls-count-do.jpg')} />}
  doNotImage={<img alt="There are two lists of inputs. The first list contains a password input. Below that list contains text that says 'Password must be at least 16 characters'. The second list contains an email input. This second list is separated so the password length requirement text is clearly associated with the password input above." src={useBaseUrl('img/item/controls-count-do-not.jpg')} />}
/>

In the example below, we are creating a list of to-do tasks. Each item has a checkbox and an input. The checkbox lets the user mark a task as complete, and the input lets the user change the name of the task.

import Controls from '@site/static/usage/v8/item/content-types/controls/index.md';

<Controls />


## Clickable Items

An item is considered "clickable" if it has an `href` or `button` property set. Clickable items have a few visual differences that indicate they can be interacted with. For example, a clickable item receives the ripple effect upon activation in `md` mode, has a highlight when activated in `ios` mode, and has a [detail arrow](#detail-arrows) by default in `ios` mode.

import Clickable from '@site/static/usage/v8/item/clickable/index.md';

<Clickable />


## Detail Arrows

By default [clickable items](#clickable-items) will display a right arrow icon on `ios` mode. To hide the right arrow icon on clickable elements, set the `detail` property to `false`. To show the right arrow icon on an item that doesn't display it naturally, set the `detail` property to `true`.

import DetailArrows from '@site/static/usage/v8/item/detail-arrows/index.md';

<DetailArrows />


<!--

TODO add this functionality back as a css variable

This feature is not enabled by default on clickable items for the `md` mode, but it can be enabled by setting the following CSS variable:

```css
--item-detail-push-show: true;
```

See the [theming documentation](/docs/theming/css-variables) for more information.

-->


## Item Lines

Items show an inset bottom border by default. The border has padding on the left and does not appear under any content that is slotted in the `"start"` slot. The `lines` property can be modified to `"full"` or `"none"` which will show a full width border or no border, respectively.

import Lines from '@site/static/usage/v8/item/lines/index.md';

<Lines />

## Buttons in Items

Buttons are styled smaller inside of items than when they are outside of them. To make the button size match buttons outside of an item, set the `size` attribute to `"default"`.

import Buttons from '@site/static/usage/v8/item/buttons/index.md';

<Buttons />

## Guidelines

The following guidelines will help ensure your list items are easy to understand and use.

1. Items should only be used inside of [Lists](./list).
2. Items inside of a list should be presented in a consistent format. For example, if your items present decorative icons, the icons should be positioned in the same way between items.
3. Items should never render [nested interactives](https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/4.4/nested-interactive). Screen readers are unable to select the correct interactive element when nested interactives are used. For example, avoid placing a button inside of an `ion-item` that has `button="true"`.
4. Use [content types](#content-types) correctly. The Item component is designed to be a row in a [List](./list) and should not be used as a general purpose container.

## Accessibility

### Keyboard Interactions

An `<ion-item>` has the following keyboard interactions when any of these conditions are met:
- The `button` property is set to `"true"`, rendering a native `<button>` element.
- The `href` property is set, rendering a native `<a>` element.
- The `routerLink` property is set, rendering a native `<a>` element.

| Key                               | Description                                    |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| <kbd>Tab</kbd>                    | Moves focus to the next focusable element.     |
| <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Tab</kbd> | Moves focus to the previous focusable element. |

#### Button

When an `<ion-item>` renders a native `<button>` element, the keyboard interactions follow the same pattern as the [button role](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/button_role#keyboard_interactions):

| Key              | Description                                                                 |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <kbd>Enter</kbd> | Activates the item, triggering its `click` event. If the item is within a form and has `type` set to `"submit"`, it submits the form. |
| <kbd>Space</kbd> | Activates the item, triggering its `click` event. Does not submit the form, even if the item `type` is `"submit"`.                    |

#### Anchor

When an `<ion-item>` renders a native `<a>` element, the keyboard interactions follow the same pattern as the [link role](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/link_role):

| Key              | Description                                                                              |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <kbd>Enter</kbd> | Activates the item, navigating to the linked page or moving focus to the in-page target. |

Label is an element used primarily to add text content to [Item](./item.md) components. Label can also be used inside of form control components such as [Input](./input.md) or [Radio](./radio.md) when specifying the visible label, but it is not required.

The position of the label inside of an item can be inline, fixed, stacked, or floating.

import EncapsulationPill from '@components/page/api/EncapsulationPill';


Lists are made up of multiple rows of [items](./item) which can contain text, buttons, toggles,
icons, thumbnails, and much more. Lists generally contain items with similar data content, such as images and text.

Lists support several interactions including swiping items to reveal options, dragging to [reorder](./reorder) items within the list, and deleting items.

## Basic Usage

import Basic from '@site/static/usage/v8/list/basic/index.md';

<Basic />


## Inset List

Adding the `inset` property to a list will apply margin around the list. In `ios` mode it will also add rounded corners to the list.

import Inset from '@site/static/usage/v8/list/inset/index.md';

<Inset />


## List Lines

Adding the `lines` property to a list will adjust the bottom borders of all of the items in the list. Setting it to `"full"` will display full width borders, `"inset"` will display borders adjusted with left padding, and `"none"` will show no borders. If the `lines` property is set on an item in a list, that will take priority over the property on the list.

<EncapsulationPill type="scoped" />


An overlay that can be used to indicate activity while blocking user interaction. The loading indicator appears on top of the app's content, and can be dismissed by the app to resume user interaction with the app. It includes an optional backdrop, which can be disabled by setting `showBackdrop: false` upon creation.

## Basic Usage

Once presented, the loading indicator will display indefinitely by default. Developers can manually dismiss the loading indicator after creation by calling the `dismiss()` method on the component. The `onDidDismiss` function can be called to perform an action after the loading indicator is dismissed.

Alternatively, developers can configure the loading indicator to dismiss automatically after a specific amount of time by passing the number of milliseconds to display it in the `duration` of the loading options.

### Inline (Recommended)

import Inline from '@site/static/usage/v8/loading/inline/index.md';

<Inline />

### Controller

import Controller from '@site/static/usage/v8/loading/controller/index.md';

## Customization

### Spinners

The spinner that is used can be customized using the `spinner` property. See the [spinner property documentation](#spinner) for a full list of options.

import Spinners from '@site/static/usage/v8/loading/spinners/index.md';

<Spinners />

### Theming

Loading uses scoped encapsulation, which means it will automatically scope its CSS by appending each of the styles with an additional class at runtime. Overriding scoped selectors in CSS requires a [higher specificity](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Specificity) selector.

We recommend passing a custom class and using that to add custom styles to the host and inner elements.

import Theming from '@site/static/usage/v8/loading/theming/index.md';

<Theming />

:::note
 `ion-loading` is presented at the root of your application, so we recommend placing any `ion-loading` styles in a global stylesheet.
:::

## Accessibility
  
Ionic automatically sets Loading's `role` to [`dialog`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/dialog_role).

If the `message` property is defined for Loading, then the `aria-labelledby` attribute will be automatically set to the message element's ID. Otherwise, `aria-labelledby` will not be set, and developers must provide an `aria-label` using the `htmlAttributes` property.
  
All ARIA attributes can be manually overwritten by defining custom values in the `htmlAttributes` property of Loading.

## Interfaces

### LoadingOptions

```typescript
interface LoadingOptions {
  spinner?: SpinnerTypes | null;

  <meta name="description" content="ion-menu components are navigation drawers that slide in from the side of the current view. Read our framework docs for the available menu types on Ionic API." />
</head>

import EncapsulationPill from '@components/page/api/EncapsulationPill';

<EncapsulationPill type="shadow" />


The menu component is a navigation drawer that slides in from the side of the current view. By default, it uses the start side, making it slide in from the left for LTR and right for RTL, but the side can be overridden. The menu will be displayed differently based on the mode, however the display type can be changed to any of the available menu types.

The menu element should be a sibling to the root content element. There can be any number of menus attached to the content. These can be controlled from the templates, or programmatically using the `MenuController`.

## Basic Usage

import Basic from '@site/static/usage/v8/menu/basic/index.md';

<Basic />


## Menu Toggle

The [menu toggle](./menu-toggle) component can be used to create custom button that can open or close the menu.

import MenuToggle from '@site/static/usage/v8/menu/toggle/index.md';

<MenuToggle />


## Menu Types

The `type` property can be used to customize how menus display in your application.

import MenuType from '@site/static/usage/v8/menu/type/index.md';

<MenuType />


## Menu Sides

Menus are displayed on the `"start"` side by default. In apps that use left-to-right direction, this is the left side, and in right-to-left apps, this will be the right side. Menus can also be set to display on the `"end"` side, which is the opposite of `"start"`.

If menus on both sides are needed in an app, the menu can be opened by passing the `side` value to the `open` method on `MenuController`. If a side is not provided, the menu on the `"start"` side will be opened. See the [multiple menus](#multiple-menus) section below for an example using `MenuController`.

import Sides from '@site/static/usage/v8/menu/sides/index.md';

<Sides />


## Multiple Menus

When multiple menus exist on the same side, we need refer to them by ID instead of side. Otherwise, the wrong menu may be activated.

import Multiple from '@site/static/usage/v8/menu/multiple/index.md';

<Multiple />

  <meta name="description" content="ion-modal is a dialog that appears on top of mobile app content, and must be dismissed before interaction resumes. Learn more about custom modal components." />
</head>

import EncapsulationPill from '@components/page/api/EncapsulationPill';

<EncapsulationPill type="shadow" />

A Modal is a dialog that appears on top of the app's content, and must be dismissed by the app before interaction can resume. It is useful as a select component when there are a lot of options to choose from, or when filtering items in a list, as well as many other use cases.

## Inline Modals (Recommended)

`ion-modal` can be used by writing the component directly in your template. This reduces the number of handlers you need to wire up in order to present the modal.

When using `ion-modal` with Angular, React, or Vue, the component you pass in will be destroyed when the modal is dismissed. As this functionality is provided by the JavaScript framework, using `ion-modal` without a JavaScript framework will not destroy the component you passed in. If this is a needed functionality, we recommend using the `modalController` instead.

import InlineModalTriggerExample from '@site/static/usage/v8/modal/inline/basic/index.md';

<InlineModalTriggerExample />

### Using `isOpen`

The `isOpen` property on `ion-modal` allows developers to control the presentation state of the modal from their application state. This means when `isOpen` is set to `true` the modal will be presented and when `isOpen` is set to `false` the modal will be dismissed.

`isOpen` uses a one-way data binding, meaning it will not automatically be set to `false` when the modal is dismissed. Developers should listen for the `ionModalDidDismiss` or `didDismiss` event and set `isOpen` to `false`. The reason for this is it prevents the internals of `ion-modal` from being tightly coupled with the state of the application. With a one way data binding, the modal only needs to concern itself with the boolean value that the reactive variable provides. With a two way data binding, the modal needs to concern itself with both the boolean value as well as the existence of the reactive variable itself. This can lead to non-deterministic behaviors and make applications harder to debug.

import InlineModalIsOpenExample from '@site/static/usage/v8/modal/inline/is-open/index.md';

<InlineModalIsOpenExample />

## Controller Modals

With the `modalController` developers can present an `ion-modal` programmatically. Developers will have complete control over when a modal is presented and dismissed.

import ControllerExample from '@site/static/usage/v8/modal/controller/index.md';

<ControllerExample />

## Preventing a Modal from Dismissing

When entering data into a modal, it is often desirable to have a way of preventing accidental data loss. The `canDismiss` property on `ion-modal` gives developers control over when a modal is allowed to dismiss.

There are two different ways of using the `canDismiss` property: setting a boolean value or setting a callback function.

:::note
 Note: When using a sheet modal, `canDismiss` will not be checked on swipe if there is no `0` breakpoint set. However, it will still be checked when pressing `Esc` or the hardware back button.
:::

### Setting a boolean value

Developers can set `canDismiss` to a boolean value. If `canDismiss` is `true`, then the modal will close when users attempt to dismiss the modal. If `canDismiss` is `false`, then the modal will not close when users attempt to dismiss the modal.

Setting a boolean value should be used when you need to require a particular action to be taken prior to a modal being dismissed. For example, if developers want to require that a "Terms of Use" checkbox is checked prior to closing the modal, they could set `canDismiss` to `false` initially and update it to `true` when the checkbox is checked.

import CanDismissBooleanExample from '@site/static/usage/v8/modal/can-dismiss/boolean/index.md';

<CanDismissBooleanExample />

### Setting a callback function

Developers can set `canDismiss` to be a function. This function must return a `Promise` that resolves to either `true` or `false`. If the promise resolves to `true`, then the modal will dismiss. If the promise resolves to `false`, then the modal will not dismiss.

Setting a callback function should be used when you have complex dismissing criteria such as showing a confirmation dialog prior to dismissing the modal. The option that users select in this dialog can then be used to determine whether or not the modal should proceed with dismissing.

Note that setting a callback function will cause the swipe gesture to be interrupted when using a card or sheet modal. This is because Ionic does not know what your callback function will resolve to ahead of time.

import CanDismissFunctionExample from '@site/static/usage/v8/modal/can-dismiss/function/index.md';

<CanDismissFunctionExample />

### Prevent swipe to close

Developers may want to prevent users from swiping to close a card or sheet modal. This can be done by setting a callback function for `canDismiss` and checking if the `role` is not `gesture`.

import CanDismissPreventSwipeToCloseExample from '@site/static/usage/v8/modal/can-dismiss/prevent-swipe-to-close/index.md';

<CanDismissPreventSwipeToCloseExample />

### Modifying dismiss behavior in child components

In certain scenarios, developers may need to customize the behavior of the `canDismiss` callback based on the state of a presented modal. This customization can be particularly useful, for instance, when developers want to prevent the modal from being dismissed if a form within it is invalid.

To achieve this customization, child components can employ various techniques such as function callbacks, event emission, or other reactivity mechanisms to communicate with the parent component and update the conditions governing the `canDismiss` callback.

Here's a simplified example illustrating how a child component can interact with a parent component to modify the `canDismiss` callback:

import CanDismissChildStateExample from '@site/static/usage/v8/modal/can-dismiss/child-state/index.md';

<CanDismissChildStateExample />

## Card Modal

Developers can create a card modal effect where the modal appears as a card stacked on top of your app's main content. To create a card modal, developers need to set the `presentingElement` property on `ion-modal`.

The `presentingElement` property accepts a reference to the element that should display under your modal. This is typically a reference to `ion-router-outlet`.

The `canDismiss` property can be used to control whether or not the card modal can be swiped to close.

:::note
The card display style is only available on iOS.
:::

import CardExample from '@site/static/usage/v8/modal/card/basic/index.md';

<CardExample />

## Sheet Modal

:::info
[Content](./content) should be used inside of the sheet modal if you want your modal content to be scrollable.
:::

Developers can create a sheet modal effect similar to the drawer components available in maps applications. To create a sheet modal, developers need to set the `breakpoints` and `initialBreakpoint` properties on `ion-modal`.

The `breakpoints` property accepts an array which states each breakpoint that the sheet can snap to when swiped. A `breakpoints` property of `[0, 0.5, 1]` would indicate that the sheet can be swiped to show 0% of the modal, 50% of the modal, and 100% of the modal. When the modal is swiped to 0%, the modal will be automatically dismissed. Note that the modal cannot be dismissed on swipe if no `0` breakpoint is included, but it can still be dismissed by pressing `Esc` or the hardware back button.

The `initialBreakpoint` property is required so that the sheet modal knows which breakpoint to start at when presenting. The `initialBreakpoint` value must also exist in the `breakpoints` array. Given a `breakpoints` value of `[0, 0.5, 1]`, an `initialBreakpoint` value of `0.5` would be valid as `0.5` is in the `breakpoints` array. An `initialBreakpoint` value of `0.25` would not be valid as `0.25` does not exist in the `breakpoints` array.

The `backdropBreakpoint` property can be used to customize the point at which the `ion-backdrop` will begin to fade in. This is useful when creating interfaces that have content underneath the sheet that should remain interactive. A common use case is a sheet modal that overlays a map where the map is interactive until the sheet is fully expanded.

import SheetExample from '@site/static/usage/v8/modal/sheet/basic/index.md';

<SheetExample />

### Interacting with background content

import SheetBackgroundContentExample from '@site/static/usage/v8/modal/sheet/background-content/index.md';

<SheetBackgroundContentExample />

### Custom Sheet Height

Developers should use the `--height` CSS Variable to change the height of the sheet modal instead of changing the last breakpoint in the `breakpoints` array. The reason for this is changing the last breakpoint in the `breakpoints` array to a value less than `1` will cause some of the modal to be inaccessible outside of the viewport.

The following example shows how to get a sheet modal that is automatically sized based on its content. Note that by keeping the maximum breakpoint at `1` we ensure that the entire modal is accessible in the viewport.

import SheetAutoHeightExample from '@site/static/usage/v8/modal/sheet/auto-height/index.md';

<SheetAutoHeightExample />

### Handle Behavior

Sheet modals can optionally render a handle indicator used for dragging the sheet between breakpoints. The `handleBehavior` property can be used to configure the behavior of when the handle is activated by the user.

import SheetHandleBehaviorExample from '@site/static/usage/v8/modal/sheet/handle-behavior/index.md';

<SheetHandleBehaviorExample />

### Scrolling content at all breakpoints

Sheet modals can be configured to allow scrolling content at all breakpoints, making them ideal for displaying content larger than the viewport. By setting the `expandToScroll` property to `false`, the content remains scrollable at every breakpoint. Otherwise, by default, scrolling is only enabled when the sheet modal is fully expanded.

import SheetScrollingContentExample from '@site/static/usage/v8/modal/sheet/expand-to-scroll/index.md';

<SheetScrollingContentExample />

## Styling

Modals are presented at the root of your application so they overlay your entire app. This behavior applies to both inline modals and modals presented from a controller. As a result, custom modal styles can not be scoped to a particular component as they will not apply to the modal. Instead, styles must be applied globally. For most developers, placing the custom styles in `global.css` is sufficient.

:::note
 If you are building an Ionic Angular app, the styles need to be added to a global stylesheet file. Read [Style Placement](#style-placement) in the Angular section below for more information.
:::


:::note
 `ion-modal` works under the assumption that stacked modals are the same size. As a result, each subsequent modal will have no box shadow and a backdrop opacity of `0`. This is to avoid the effect of shadows and backdrops getting darker with each added modal. This can be changed by setting the `--box-shadow` and `--backdrop-opacity` CSS variables:
:::

```
ion-modal.stack-modal {
  --box-shadow: 0 28px 48px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.4);
  --backdrop-opacity: var(--ion-backdrop-opacity, 0.32);
}
```

import ThemeExample from '@site/static/usage/v8/modal/styling/theming/index.md';

<ThemeExample />

### Animations

The enter and leave animations can be customized by using our animation builder and assigning animations to `enterAnimation` and `leaveAnimation`.

import AnimationsExample from '@site/static/usage/v8/modal/styling/animations/index.md';

<AnimationsExample />

## Custom Dialogs

While `ion-modal` is most often used for full-page views, cards, or sheets, it is also possible to use it for custom dialogs. This is useful if developers need an interface that is more complex than what components such as [ion-alert](./alert) or [ion-loading](./loading) provide.

import CustomDialogs from '@site/static/usage/v8/modal/custom-dialogs/index.md';

<CustomDialogs />

A few things to keep in mind when creating custom dialogs:

* `ion-content` is intended to be used in full-page modals, cards, and sheets. If your custom dialog has a dynamic or unknown size, `ion-content` should not be used.
* Creating custom dialogs provides a way of ejecting from the default modal experience. As a result, custom dialogs should not be used with card or sheet modals.

## Interfaces

### ModalOptions

Below you will find all of the options available to you when using the `modalController`. These options should be supplied when calling `modalController.create()`.

```typescript
interface ModalOptions {
  component: any;
  componentProps?: { [key: string]: any };
  presentingElement?: HTMLElement;
  showBackdrop?: boolean;
  backdropDismiss?: boolean;
  cssClass?: string | string[];
  animated?: boolean;
  canDismiss?: boolean | ((data?: any, role?: string) => Promise<boolean>);

  mode?: 'ios' | 'md';
  keyboardClose?: boolean;
  id?: string;
  htmlAttributes?: { [key: string]: any };

  enterAnimation?: AnimationBuilder;
  leaveAnimation?: AnimationBuilder;

  breakpoints?: number[];
  initialBreakpoint?: number;
  backdropBreakpoint?: number;
  handle?: boolean;
}
```
### ModalCustomEvent

While not required, this interface can be used in place of the `CustomEvent` interface for stronger typing with Ionic events emitted from this component.

```typescript
interface ModalCustomEvent extends CustomEvent {
  target: HTMLIonModalElement;
}
```

## Accessibility

### Keyboard Interactions

| Key             | Description         |
| --------------- | ------------------- |
| <kbd>Esc</kbd>  | Dismisses the modal |


### Labels

Modals have a [`dialog`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/dialog_role) role. As a result, developers **must** properly label their modals. If the modal is using `ion-title`, the text inside can be used to label the modal itself by setting [`aria-labelledby`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-labelledby) on `ion-modal`. If the modal contains additional descriptive text, this text can be associated with the modal by using [`aria-describedby`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-describedby).

### Screen Readers

Modals have the `aria-modal` attribute applied. This attribute can cause assistive technologies to limit navigation to the modal element's contents. As a result, using gestures that move to the next or previous items may not focus elements outside of the modal. This applies even when the backdrop is disabled in sheet modals using the `backdropBreakpoint` property.

Assistive technologies will not limit navigation to the modal element's contents if developers manually move focus. However, manually moving focus outside of a modal is not supported in Ionic for modals that have focus trapping enabled.

See https://w3c.github.io/aria/#aria-modal for more information.

### Focus Trapping

When a modal is presented, focus will be trapped inside of the presented modal. Users can focus other interactive elements inside the modal but will never be able to focus interactive elements outside the modal while the modal is presented. For applications that present multiple stacked modals, focus will be trapped on the modal that was presented last.

Sheet modals that have had their backdrop disabled by the `backdropBreakpoint` property are not subject to focus trapping.

### Sheet Modals

Sheet modals allow users to interact with content behind the modal when the `backdropBreakpoint` property is used. The backdrop will be disabled up to and including the specified `backdropBreakpoint` and will be enabled after it.

When the backdrop is disabled, users will be able to interact with elements outside the sheet modal using a pointer or keyboard. Assistive technologies may not focus outside the sheet modal by default due to the usage of `aria-modal`. We recommend avoiding features such as autofocus here as it can cause assistive technologies to jump between two interactive contexts without warning the user.

## Performance

### Mounting Inner Contents

The content of an inline `ion-modal` is unmounted when closed. If this content is expensive to render, developers can use the `keepContentsMounted` property to mount the content as soon as the modal is mounted. This can help optimize the responsiveness of your application as the inner contents will have already been mounted when the modal opens.

import Mount from '@site/static/usage/v8/modal/performance/mount/index.md';

<Mount />

Developers should keep the following in mind when using `keepContentsMounted`:

- This feature should be used as a last resort in order to deal with existing performance problems. Try to identify and resolve performance bottlenecks before using this feature. Additionally, do not use this to anticipate performance problems.

- This feature is only needed when using a JavaScript Framework. Developers not using a framework can  pass the contents to be rendered into the modal, and the contents will be rendered automatically.

- This feature only works with inline modals. Modals created with the `modalController` are not created ahead of time, so the inner contents are not created either.

- Any JavaScript Framework lifecycle hooks on the inner component will run as soon as the modal is mounted, not when the modal is presented.

</head>

import EncapsulationPill from '@components/page/api/EncapsulationPill';

<EncapsulationPill type="shadow" />

Nav is a standalone component for loading arbitrary components and pushing new components on to the stack.

Unlike Router Outlet, Nav is not tied to a particular router. This means that if we load a Nav component, and push other components to the stack, they will not affect the app's overall router. For example, you should not push a new component to `ion-nav` and expect the URL to update. This fits use cases where you could have a modal, which needs its own sub-navigation, without making it tied to the apps URL.

:::note
`ion-nav` is not meant to be used for routing.  Instead, see the routing guides for [Angular](../angular/navigation), [React](../react/navigation), and [Vue](../vue/navigation), or [`ion-router`](./router) for vanilla JavaScript projects.
:::

## Using NavLink

NavLink is a simplified API when interacting with Nav. Developers can customize the component, pass along component properties, modify the direction of the route animation or define a custom animation when navigating. 

import NavLinkExample from '@site/static/usage/v8/nav/nav-link/index.md'; 

<NavLinkExample />

## Navigation within a Modal

Modal can use Nav to offer a linear navigation that is independent of the URL.

:::note

The example below uses a reference to Nav and the public method APIs to push and pop views. It is recommended to use NavLink in implementations that do not require this level of granular access and control.

<EncapsulationPill type="scoped" />

:::warning Deprecation Notice

`ion-picker-legacy` is deprecated and will be removed in the next major release. Migrate to [`ion-picker`](./picker.md) as soon as possible.

:::

A Picker is a dialog that displays a row of buttons and columns underneath. It appears on top of the app's content, and at the bottom of the viewport.

## Inline Pickers (Recommended)

`ion-picker-legacy` can be used by writing the component directly in your template. This reduces the number of handlers you need to wire up in order to present the Picker.

import Trigger from '@site/static/usage/v8/picker-legacy/inline/trigger/index.md';

<Trigger />

### Using `isOpen`

The `isOpen` property on `ion-picker-legacy` allows developers to control the presentation state of the Picker from their application state. This means when `isOpen` is set to `true` the Picker will be presented, and when `isOpen` is set to `false` the Picker will be dismissed.

`isOpen` uses a one-way data binding, meaning it will not automatically be set to `false` when the Picker is dismissed. Developers should listen for the `ionPickerDidDismiss` or `didDismiss` event and set `isOpen` to `false`. The reason for this is it prevents the internals of `ion-picker` from being tightly coupled with the state of the application. With a one way data binding, the Picker only needs to concern itself with the boolean value that the reactive variable provides. With a two way data binding, the Picker needs to concern itself with both the boolean value as well as the existence of the reactive variable itself. This can lead to non-deterministic behaviors and make applications harder to debug.

import IsOpen from '@site/static/usage/v8/picker-legacy/inline/isOpen/index.md';

<IsOpen />

## Controller Pickers

The `pickerController` can be used in situations where more control is needed over when the Picker is presented and dismissed.

import Controller from '@site/static/usage/v8/picker-legacy/controller/index.md';

<Controller />

## Multiple Columns

The `columns` property can be used to display a Picker with multiple columns of different options.

import MultipleColumn from '@site/static/usage/v8/picker-legacy/multiple-column/index.md';

<MultipleColumn />

## Interfaces

### PickerButton

```typescript
interface PickerButton {
  text?: string;
  role?: string;
  cssClass?: string | string[];
  handler?: (value: any) => boolean | void;
}
```

### PickerColumn

```typescript
interface PickerColumn {
  name: string;
  align?: string;
  /**
   * Changing this value allows the initial value of a picker column to be set.
   */
  selectedIndex?: number;
  prevSelected?: number;
  prefix?: string;
  suffix?: string;
  options: PickerColumnOption[];
  cssClass?: string | string[];
  columnWidth?: string;
  prefixWidth?: string;
  suffixWidth?: string;
  optionsWidth?: string;
}
```

### PickerColumnOption

```typescript
interface PickerColumnOption {
  text?: string;
  value?: any;
  disabled?: boolean;
  duration?: number;
  transform?: string;
  selected?: boolean;
  /**
   * The optional text to assign as the aria-label on the picker column option.
   */
  ariaLabel?: string;
}
```

import PrefixSuffix from '@site/static/usage/v8/picker/prefix-suffix/index.md';

<PrefixSuffix />

## Theming

### CSS Variables

The picker highlight and fade can be customized using CSS variables on `ion-picker`. Developers can customize the individual appearance of `ion-picker-column-options` by targeting them directly and using host level styling.

import CSSProps from '@site/static/usage/v8/picker/theming/css-properties/index.md';

<CSSProps />

## Picker in Modal

Pickers can be displayed inside of overlays, such as `ion-modal` to create a picker experience with confirmation or cancellation buttons.

import ModalExample from '@site/static/usage/v8/picker/modal/index.md';

<ModalExample />

## Accessibility

### Screen Readers

Picker supports navigation using a screen reader by implementing the [`slider` role](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/slider_role) on each [Picker Column](./picker-column). The following gestures can be used to navigate the Picker.

| Gesture | Function |
| - | - |
| Swipe Left | Move focus to the previous Picker Column. |
| Swipe Right | Move focus to the next Picker Column. |
| Swipe Up | Select the next option in the Picker Column. |
| Swipe Down | Select the previous option in the Picker Column. |
| Double Tap and Slide Up/Down | Adjust the selected option in the Picker Column. Can be used as an alternative to swiping up and down. |

:::caution
The Swipe Up and Swipe Down gestures rely on the correct key events being synthesized as noted on the [`slider` documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/slider_role). [Chromium-based browsers do not synthesize keyboard events correctly](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/40816094), but the "Double Tap and Slide Up/Down" gesture can be used as an alternative until this has been implemented in Chromium-based browsers.
:::

### Keyboard Interactions

Each [Picker Column](./picker-column) can be navigated using the keyboard when focused.

| Key                  | Description                          |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| <kbd>ArrowUp</kbd>   | Scroll to the previous option.       |
| <kbd>ArrowDown</kbd> | Scroll to the next option.           |
| <kbd>PageUp</kbd>    | Scroll up by more than one option.   |

<EncapsulationPill type="shadow" />


A Popover is a dialog that appears on top of the current page. It can be used for anything, but generally it is used for overflow actions that don't fit in the navigation bar.

There are two ways to use `ion-popover`: inline or via the `popoverController`. Each method comes with different considerations, so be sure to use the approach that best fits your use case.

## Inline Popovers

`ion-popover` can be used by writing the component directly in your template. This reduces the number of handlers you need to wire up in order to present the popover.

When using `ion-popover` with Angular, React, or Vue, the component you pass in will be destroyed when the popover is dismissed. As this functionality is provided by the JavaScript framework, using `ion-popover` without a JavaScript framework will not destroy the component you passed in. If this is a needed functionality, we recommend using the `popoverController` instead.

### When to use

Using a popover inline is useful when you do not want to explicitly wire up click events to open the popover. For example, you can use the `trigger` property to designate a button that should present the popover when clicked. You can also use the `trigger-action` property to customize whether the popover should be presented when the trigger is left clicked, right clicked, or hovered over.

If you need fine grained control over when the popover is presented and dismissed, we recommend you use the `popoverController`.

### Angular

Since the component you passed in needs to be created when the popover is presented and destroyed when the popover is dismissed, we are unable to project the content using `<ng-content>` internally. Instead, we use `<ng-container>` which expects an `<ng-template>` to be passed in. As a result, when passing in your component you will need to wrap it in an `<ng-template>`:

```html
<ion-popover [isOpen]="isPopoverOpen">
  <ng-template>
    <app-popover-content></app-popover-content>
  </ng-template>
</ion-popover>
```

### Triggers

A trigger for an inline `ion-popover` is the element that will open a popover when interacted with. The interaction behavior can be customized by setting the `trigger-action` property. Note that `trigger-action="context-menu"` will prevent your system's default context menu from opening.

:::note
 Triggers are not applicable when using the `popoverController` because the `ion-popover` is not created ahead of time.
:::

import InlineTrigger from '@site/static/usage/v8/popover/presenting/inline-trigger/index.md';

<InlineTrigger />

### isOpen Property

Inline popovers can also be opened by setting the `isOpen` property to `true`. This method can be used if you need finer grained control over the popover than with a trigger.

`isOpen` uses a one-way data binding, meaning it will not automatically be set to `false` when the popover is dismissed. Developers should listen for the `ionPopoverDidDismiss` or `didDismiss` event and set `isOpen` to `false`. The reason for this is it prevents the internals of `ion-popover` from being tightly coupled with the state of the application. With a one way data binding, the popover only needs to concern itself with the boolean value that the reactive variable provides. With a two way data binding, the popover needs to concern itself with both the boolean value as well as the existence of the reactive variable itself. This can lead to non-deterministic behaviors and make applications harder to debug.


import IsOpenTrigger from '@site/static/usage/v8/popover/presenting/inline-isopen/index.md';

<IsOpenTrigger />

## Controller Popovers

`ion-popover` can also be presented programmatically by using the `popoverController` imported from Ionic Framework. This allows you to have complete control over when a popover is presented above and beyond the customization that inline popovers give you.

### When to use

We typically recommend that you write your popovers inline as it streamlines the amount of code in your application. You should only use the `popoverController` for complex use cases where writing a popover inline is impractical. When using a controller, your popover is not created ahead of time, so properties such as `trigger` and `trigger-action` are not applicable here. In addition, nested popovers are not compatible with the controller approach because the popover is automatically added to the root of your application when the `create` method is called.

### React

Instead of a controller, React has a hook called `useIonPopover` which behaves in a similar fashion. Note that `useIonPopover` requires being a descendant of `<IonApp>`. If you need to use a popover outside of an `<IonApp>`, consider using an inline popover instead.

### Usage

import ControllerExample from '@site/static/usage/v8/popover/presenting/controller/index.md';

<ControllerExample />


## Styling

Popovers are presented at the root of your application so they overlay your entire app. This behavior applies to both inline popovers and popovers presented from a controller. As a result, custom popover styles can not be scoped to a particular component as they will not apply to the popover. Instead, styles must be applied globally. For most developers, placing the custom styles in `global.css` is sufficient.

:::note
 If you are building an Ionic Angular app, the styles need to be added to a global stylesheet file.
:::

import Styling from '@site/static/usage/v8/popover/customization/styling/index.md';

<Styling />


## Positioning

### Reference

When presenting a popover, Ionic Framework needs a reference point to present the popover relative to. With `reference="event"`, the popover will be presented relative to the x-y coordinates of the pointer event that was dispatched on your trigger element. With `reference="trigger"`, the popover will be presented relative to the bounding box of your trigger element.

### Side

Regardless of what you choose for your reference point, you can position a popover to the `top`, `right`, `left`, or `bottom` of your reference point by using the `side` property. You can also use the `start` or `end` values if you would like the side to switch based on LTR or RTL modes.

### Alignment

The `alignment` property allows you to line up an edge of your popover with a corresponding edge on your trigger element. The exact edge that is used depends on the value of the `side` property.

### Side and Alignment Demo

import Positioning from '@site/static/usage/v8/popover/customization/positioning/index.md';

<Positioning />

### Offsets

If you need finer grained control over the positioning of your popover you can use the `--offset-x` and `--offset-y` CSS Variables. For example, `--offset-x: 10px` will move your popover content to the right by `10px`.

## Sizing

When making dropdown menus, you may want to have the width of the popover match the width of the trigger element. Doing this without knowing the trigger width ahead of time is tricky. You can set the `size` property to `'cover'` and Ionic Framework will ensure that the width of the popover matches the width of your trigger element.

If you are using the `popoverController`, you must provide an event via the `event` option and Ionic Framework will use `event.target` as the reference element. See the [controller demo](#controller-popovers) for an example of this pattern.

import Sizing from '@site/static/usage/v8/popover/customization/sizing/index.md';

<Sizing />

## Nested Popovers

When using `ion-popover` inline, you can nested popovers to create nested dropdown menus. When doing this, only the backdrop on the first popover will appear so that the screen does not get progressively darker as you open more popovers.

You can use the `dismissOnSelect` property to automatically close the popover when the popover content has been clicked. This behavior does not apply when clicking a trigger element for another popover.

:::note
 Nested popovers cannot be created when using the `popoverController` because the popover is automatically added to the root of your application when the `create` method is called.
:::

import NestedPopover from '@site/static/usage/v8/popover/nested/index.md';

<NestedPopover />


## Interfaces

Below you will find all of the options available to you when using the `popoverController`. These options should be supplied when calling `popoverController.create()`.

```typescript
interface PopoverOptions {
  component: any;
  componentProps?: { [key: string]: any };
  showBackdrop?: boolean;
  backdropDismiss?: boolean;
  translucent?: boolean;
  cssClass?: string | string[];
  event?: Event;
  animated?: boolean;

  mode?: 'ios' | 'md';
  keyboardClose?: boolean;
  id?: string;
  htmlAttributes?: { [key: string]: any };

  enterAnimation?: AnimationBuilder;
  leaveAnimation?: AnimationBuilder;

  size?: PopoverSize;
  dismissOnSelect?: boolean;
  reference?: PositionReference;
  side?: PositionSide;
  alignment?: PositionAlign;
  arrow?: boolean;
}
```


## Types

Below you will find all of the custom types for `ion-popover`:

```typescript
type PopoverSize = 'cover' | 'auto';
type TriggerAction = 'click' | 'hover' | 'context-menu';
type PositionReference = 'trigger' | 'event';
type PositionSide = 'top' | 'right' | 'bottom' | 'left' | 'start' | 'end';
type PositionAlign = 'start' | 'center' | 'end';
```

## Accessibility

### Keyboard Interactions

`ion-popover` has basic keyboard support for navigating between focusable elements inside of the popover. The following table details what each key does:

| Key                                  | Description                                    |
| ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| <kbd>Tab</kbd>                       | Moves focus to the next focusable element.     |
| <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Tab</kbd>    | Moves focus to the previous focusable element. |
| <kbd>Esc</kbd>                       | Closes the popover.                            |
| <kbd>Space</kbd> or <kbd>Enter</kbd> | Clicks the focusable element.                  |

`ion-popover` has full arrow key support for navigating between `ion-item` elements with the `button` property. The most common use case for this is as a dropdown menu in a desktop-focused application. In addition to the basic keyboard support, the following table details arrow key support for dropdown menus:

| Key                                                           | Description                                                                               |
| ------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <kbd>ArrowUp</kbd>                                            | Moves focus to the previous focusable element.                                            |
| <kbd>ArrowDown</kbd>                                          | Moves focus to the next focusable element.                                                |
| <kbd>Home</kbd>                                               | Moves focus to the first focusable element.                                               |
| <kbd>End</kbd>                                                | Moves focus to the last focusable element.                                                |
| <kbd>ArrowLeft</kbd>                                          | When used in a child popover, closes the popover and returns focus to the parent popover. |
| <kbd>Space</kbd>, <kbd>Enter</kbd>, and <kbd>ArrowRight</kbd> | When focusing a trigger element, opens the associated popover.                            |

## Performance

### Mounting Inner Contents

The content of an inline `ion-popover` is unmounted when closed. If this content is expensive to render, developers can use the `keepContentsMounted` property to mount the content as soon as the popover is mounted. This can help optimize the responsiveness of your application as the inner contents will have already been mounted when the popover opens.

import Mount from '@site/static/usage/v8/popover/performance/mount/index.md';

<Mount />

Developers should keep the following in mind when using `keepContentsMounted`:

- This feature should be used as a last resort in order to deal with existing performance problems. Try to identify and resolve performance bottlenecks before using this feature. Additionally, do not use this to anticipate performance problems.

- This feature is only needed when using a JavaScript Framework. Developers not using a framework can  pass the contents to be rendered into the popover, and the contents will be rendered automatically.

- This feature only works with inline popovers. Popovers created with the `popoverController` are not created ahead of time, so the inner contents are not created either.

- Any JavaScript Framework lifecycle hooks on the inner component will run as soon as the popover is mounted, not when the popover is presented.

Progress bars inform users about the status of ongoing processes, such as loading an app, submitting a form, or saving updates. There are two types of progress bars: `determinate` and `indeterminate`.

## Determinate

Determinate is the default type. It should be used when the percentage of an operation is known. The progress is represented by setting the `value` property. This can be used to show the progress increasing from 0 to 100% of the track.

import Determinate from '@site/static/usage/v8/progress-bar/determinate/index.md';

<Determinate />

### Buffer

If the `buffer` property is set, a buffer stream will show with animated circles to indicate activity. The value of the `buffer` property will also be represented by how much visible track there is. If the value of `buffer` is less than the `value` property, there will be no visible track. If `buffer` is equal to `1` then the buffer stream will be hidden.

import Buffer from '@site/static/usage/v8/progress-bar/buffer/index.md';

<Buffer />


## Indeterminate

The indeterminate type should be used when it is unknown how long the process will take. The progress bar is not tied to the `value`, instead it continually slides along the track until the process is complete.

A radio group is a container for a group of [radios](./radio). It allows a user to select at most one radio button from a set. Checking one radio button that belongs to a radio group unchecks any previous checked radio button within the same group. For example usage of the radio group, see the [radio](./radio) documentation.

  <meta name="description" content="Radio components should be used inside of ion-radio-groups on iOS and Android devices. Read to learn more about radio property usage and installation." />
</head>

import EncapsulationPill from '@components/page/api/EncapsulationPill';

<EncapsulationPill type="shadow" />


Radios should be used inside of a [radio group](./radio-group). Pressing a radio will check it and uncheck the previously selected radio, if there is one. They can also be checked programmatically by setting the value property of the parent radio group to the value of the radio.

When radios are inside of a radio group, only one radio will be checked at any time. If more than one item should be selected, [checkboxes](./checkbox) should be used instead. Radios can be disabled within a group to prevent interaction with them.

## Basic Usage

import Basic from '@site/static/usage/v8/radio/basic/index.md';

<Basic />

## Label Placement

Developers can use the `labelPlacement` property to control how the label is placed relative to the control.  This property mirrors the flexbox `flex-direction` property.

import LabelPlacement from '@site/static/usage/v8/radio/label-placement/index.md';

<LabelPlacement />

## Label Wrapping

Regardless of label placement, long text will not wrap by default. If the width of the radio is constrained, overflowing text will be truncated with an ellipsis. You can enable text wrapping by adding the `ion-text-wrap` class to a wrapper around the radio text or styling the `label` shadow part using the `::part()` selector.

import LabelWrap from '@site/static/usage/v8/radio/label-wrap/index.md';

<LabelWrap />

## Object Value References

By default, the radio group uses strict equality (`===`) to determine if an option is selected. This can be overridden by providing a property name or a function to the `compareWith` property.

import UsingComparewith from '@site/static/usage/v8/radio/using-comparewith/index.md';

<UsingComparewith />

## Alignment

Developers can use the `alignment` property to control how the label and control are aligned on the cross axis. This property mirrors the flexbox `align-items` property.

:::note
Stacked radios can be aligned using the `alignment` property. This can be useful when the label and control need to be centered horizontally.
:::

import Alignment from '@site/static/usage/v8/radio/alignment/index.md';

<Alignment />

## Justification

Developers can use the `justify` property to control how the label and control are packed on a line. This property mirrors the flexbox `justify-content` property.

import Justify from '@site/static/usage/v8/radio/justify/index.md';

<Justify />

:::note
`ion-item` is only used in the demos to emphasize how `justify` works. It is not needed in order for `justify` to function correctly.
:::

## Deselecting Radios

By default, once a radio is selected it cannot be deselected; pressing it again will keep it selected. This behavior can be modified by using the `allowEmptySelection` property on the parent radio group, which enables the radios to be deselected.

import EmptySelection from '@site/static/usage/v8/radio/empty-selection/index.md';

<EmptySelection />

## Helper & Error Text

Helper and error text can be used inside of a radio group with the `helperText` and `errorText` property. The error text will not be displayed unless the `ion-invalid` and `ion-touched` classes are added to the `ion-radio-group`. This ensures errors are not shown before the user has a chance to enter data.

In Angular, this is done automatically through form validation. In JavaScript, React and Vue, the class needs to be manually added based on your own validation.

import HelperError from '@site/static/usage/v8/radio/helper-error/index.md';

<HelperError />

  <title>ion-range: Range Slider Knob Controls with Labels</title>
  <meta name="description" content="ion-range lets you select from a range of values by moving the slider. It accepts dual knobs but one controls the value and labels can be placed on either side." />
</head>

import EncapsulationPill from '@components/page/api/EncapsulationPill';

<EncapsulationPill type="shadow" />


The Range slider lets users select from a range of values by moving the slider knob. By default one knob controls the value of the range. This behavior can be customized using [dual knobs](#dual-knobs).

By default the Range slider has a minimum value of `0` and a maximum value of `100`. This can be configured with the `min` and `max` properties.

## Labels

Labels should be used to describe the range. They can be used visually, and they will also be read out by screen readers when the user is focused on the range. This makes it easy for the user to understand the intent of the range. Range has several ways to assign a label:

- `label` property: used for plaintext labels
- `label` slot: used for custom HTML labels
- `aria-label`: used to provide a label for screen readers but adds no visible label

### Label Placement

The below demo shows how to use the `labelPlacement` property to change the position of the label relative to the range. While the `label` property is used here, `labelPlacement` can also be used with the `label` slot.

import LabelsPlayground from '@site/static/usage/v8/range/labels/index.md';

<LabelsPlayground />

### Label Slot

While plaintext labels should be passed in via the `label` property, if custom HTML is needed, it can be passed through the `label` slot instead.

import LabelSlotPlayground from '@site/static/usage/v8/range/label-slot/index.md';

<LabelSlotPlayground />

### No Visible Label

If no visible label is needed, developers should still supply an `aria-label` so the range is accessible to screen readers.

import NoVisibleLabel from '@site/static/usage/v8/range/no-visible-label/index.md';

<NoVisibleLabel />

## Decorations

Decorative elements can be passed into the `start` or `end` slots of the range. This is useful for adding icons such as low volume or high volume icons. Since these elements are decorative, they should not be announced by assistive technology such as screen readers.

If the directionality of the document is set to left to right, the contents slotted to the `start` position will display to the left of the range, where as contents slotted to the `end` position will display to the right of the range. In right to left (rtl) directionality, the contents slotted to the `start` position will display to the right of the range, where as contents slotted to the `end` position will display to the left of the range.

import DecorationsPlayground from '@site/static/usage/v8/range/slots/index.md';

<DecorationsPlayground />

## Dual Knobs

Dual knobs introduce two knob controls that users can use to select a value at a lower and upper bounds. When selected, the Range will emit an `ionChange` event with a [RangeValue](#rangevalue), containing the upper and lower values selected.

import DualKnobs from '@site/static/usage/v8/range/dual-knobs/index.md';

<DualKnobs />

## Pins

The `pin` attribute will display the value of the Range above the knob when dragged. This allows users to select a specific value within the Range.

With the `pinFormatter` function, developers can customize the formatting of the range value to the user.

import Pins from '@site/static/usage/v8/range/pins/index.md';

<Pins />

## Snapping & Ticks

Ticks show indications for each available value on the Range. In order to use ticks, developers must set both `snaps` and the `ticks` property to `true`.

With snapping enabled, the Range knob will snap to the nearest available value as the knob is dragged and released.

import SnappingTicks from '@site/static/usage/v8/range/snapping-ticks/index.md';

<SnappingTicks />

## Event Handling

### Using `ionChange`

The `ionChange` event emits as the Range knob value changes.

import IonChangeEvent from '@site/static/usage/v8/range/ion-change-event/index.md';

<IonChangeEvent />

### Using `ionKnobMoveStart` and `ionKnobMoveEnd`

The `ionKnobMoveStart` event emits when the Range knob begins dragging, whether through mouse drag, touch gesture or keyboard interaction. Inversely, `ionKnobMoveEnd` emits when the Range knob is released. Both events emit with the `RangeValue` type and work in combination with the `dualKnobs` property.

import IonKnobMoveEvent from '@site/static/usage/v8/range/ion-knob-move-event/index.md';

<IonKnobMoveEvent />

## Theming

### CSS Custom Properties

Range includes [CSS Variables](#css-custom-properties) to quickly theme and customize the appearance of the Range component to match your application's design.

import CSSProps from '@site/static/usage/v8/range/theming/css-properties/index.md';

<CSSProps />

### CSS Shadow Parts

Range includes [CSS Shadow Parts](#css-shadow-parts) to allow complete customization of specific element nodes within the Range component. CSS Shadow Parts offer the most customization capabilities and are the recommended approach when requiring advance styling with the Range component.

import CSSParts from '@site/static/usage/v8/range/theming/css-shadow-parts/index.md';

The refresher content contains the text, icon and spinner to display during a pull-to-refresh. Ionic displays a pulling icon and refreshing spinner based on the platform. However, the default icon, spinner, and text can be customized based on the state of the refresher.

For usage examples, see the [Refresher](/docs/api/refresher) documentation.

  <title>ion-refresher: Pull-to-Refresh Page Content on Ionic Apps</title>
  <meta name="description" content="ion-refresher provides pull-to-refresh functionality on content components. Learn how this lets users pull down on a page using touch to retrieve more data." />
</head>

import EncapsulationPill from '@components/page/api/EncapsulationPill';


Refresher provides pull-to-refresh functionality on a content component. The pull-to-refresh pattern lets a user pull down on a list of data in order to retrieve more data.

Data should be modified during the refresher's output events. Once the async operation has completed and the refreshing should end, `complete()` needs to be called on the refresher.


## Basic Usage

import Basic from '@site/static/usage/v8/refresher/basic/index.md';

<Basic />


## Pull Properties

The refresher has several properties for customizing the pull gesture. Set the `pullFactor` to change the speed of the pull, the `pullMin` property to change the minimum distance the user must pull down, and the `pullMax` property to change the maximum distance the user must pull down before the refresher enters the `refreshing` state.

These properties do not apply when the [native refresher](#native-refreshers) is enabled.

import PullProperties from '@site/static/usage/v8/refresher/pull-properties/index.md';

<PullProperties />


## Custom Refresher Content

The default icon, spinner, and text can be customized on the [refresher content](./refresher-content) based on whether the state of the refresher is `pulling` or `refreshing`.

Setting `pullingIcon` will disable the [native refresher](#native-refreshers).

import CustomContent from '@site/static/usage/v8/refresher/custom-content/index.md';

<CustomContent />


## Native Refreshers

Both iOS and Android platforms provide refreshers that use properties exposed by their respective devices in order to give pull-to-refresh a fluid, native-like feel.

The iOS and Material Design native refreshers are enabled by default in Ionic. However, the native iOS refresher relies on rubber band scrolling in order to work properly and is only compatible with iOS devices as a result. We provide a fallback refresher for apps running in iOS mode on devices that do not support rubber band scrolling.

The native refresher uses a `circular` spinner for Material Design, while iOS uses the `lines` spinner. On iOS, the tick marks will progressively show as the page is pulled down.

Certain refresher properties such as the [Pull Properties](#pull-properties), `closeDuration` and `snapbackDuration` are not compatible because much of the native refreshers are scroll-based. See [Properties](#properties) for more information on unsupported properties.

The native refreshers can be disabled by setting the `pullingIcon` on the [refresher content](#custom-refresher-content) to any icon or spinner. See the [Ionicons](https://ionic.io/ionicons) and [Spinner](./spinner) documentation for accepted values.


## Usage with Virtual Scroll

Refresher requires a scroll container to function. When using a virtual scrolling solution, you will need to disable scrolling on the `ion-content` and indicate which element container is responsible for the scroll container with the `.ion-content-scroll-host` class target.

Developers should apply the following CSS to the scrollable container. This CSS adds a "rubber band" scrolling effect on iOS which allows the native iOS refresher to work properly:

```css
.ion-content-scroll-host::before,
.ion-content-scroll-host::after {
  position: absolute;
  
  width: 1px;
  height: 1px;
  
  content: "";
}

.ion-content-scroll-host::before {
  bottom: -1px;
}

.ion-content-scroll-host::after {
  top: -1px;
}
```

import CustomScrollTarget from '@site/static/usage/v8/refresher/custom-scroll-target/index.md';

<CustomScrollTarget />


## Advanced Usage

While the refresher can be used with any type of content, a common use case in native apps is to display a list of data that gets updated on refresh. In the below example, the app generates a list of data and then appends data to the top of the list when the refresh is completed. In a real app, the data would be received and updated after sending a request via a network or database call.

import Advanced from '@site/static/usage/v8/refresher/advanced/index.md';

<Advanced />

import EncapsulationPill from '@components/page/api/EncapsulationPill';


The reorder group is a container for items using the [reorder](./reorder) component. When the user drags an item and drops it, the `ionReorderEnd` event is dispatched. A handler for this event should be implemented that calls the `complete` method.

The `detail` property of the `ionReorderEnd` event includes all of the relevant information about the reorder operation, including the `from` and `to` indexes. In the context of reordering, an item moves `from` an index `to` an index. For example usage of the reorder group, see the [reorder](./reorder) documentation.

</head>

import EncapsulationPill from '@components/page/api/EncapsulationPill';

<EncapsulationPill type="shadow" />


Reorder is a component that allows an item to be dragged to change its order within a group of items. It must be used within a [reorder group](./reorder-group) to provide a visual drag and drop interface.

The reorder is the anchor used to drag and drop the items. Once the reorder is complete, the `ionReorderEnd` event will be dispatched from the reorder group and the `complete` method needs to be called.


## Basic Usage

The most basic example of a reorder is slotting it inside of an item. By default, the reorder functionality is disabled for a reorder group. It can be enabled by setting the `disabled` property on the reorder group to `false`. The reorder icon can then be used to drag and drop the items and reorder them.

import Basic from '@site/static/usage/v8/reorder/basic/index.md';

<Basic />


## Toggling Reorder

In some cases, it may be desired to have the option to toggle the reorder functionality. This can be done by making the `disabled` property reactive, based on a function or variable.

import TogglingDisabled from '@site/static/usage/v8/reorder/toggling-disabled/index.md';

<TogglingDisabled />


## Custom Reorder Icon

The reorder component uses a reorder icon with three lines on iOS and two lines on Material Design. This can be customized by adding an [Icon](https://ionic.io/ionicons) component inside of the reorder with any of the available Ionicons.

import CustomIcon from '@site/static/usage/v8/reorder/custom-icon/index.md';

<CustomIcon />


## Reorder Wrapper

Reorder can also be used as a wrapper around an item, making the item itself the anchor. Click anywhere on an item below and drag it to reorder the list.

import Wrapper from '@site/static/usage/v8/reorder/wrapper/index.md';

<Wrapper />


## Updating Data

When the `complete` method is called on the reorder group with no parameters, the DOM nodes will be reordered. If the items are rendered from an array of data that needs to be sorted, this can result in the data and DOM being out of sync.

In order to sort the array upon completion of the reorder, the array should be passed as a parameter to the `complete` method. The `complete` method will sort the array and return it so it can be reassigned. Note that passing the array will prevent Ionic from reordering the DOM nodes.

In some cases, it may be necessary for an app to reorder both the array and the DOM nodes on its own. If this is required, `false` should be passed as a parameter to the `complete` method. This will prevent Ionic from reordering any DOM nodes inside of the reorder group.

Regardless of the approach taken, a stable identity should be provided to reorder items if provided in a loop. This means using `track` for Angular, and `key` for React and Vue.

import UpdatingData from '@site/static/usage/v8/reorder/updating-data/index.md';

<UpdatingData />

## Event Handling

### Using `ionReorderStart` and `ionReorderEnd`

The `ionReorderStart` event is emitted when the user begins a reorder gesture. This event fires when the user taps and holds an item, before any movement occurs. This is useful for preparing the UI for the reorder operation, such as hiding certain elements or updating the visual state of items. For example, icons in list items can be hidden while they are being dragged and shown again when the reorder is complete.

The `ionReorderEnd` event is emitted when the user completes the reorder gesture. This occurs when the user releases the item they are dragging, for example by lifting their finger on a touch screen or releasing the mouse button. The event includes the `from` and `to` indices of the item, as well as the `complete` method that should be called to finalize the reorder operation. The `from` index will always be the position of the item when the gesture started, while the `to` index will be its final position. This event will fire even if no items have changed position, in which case the `from` and `to` indices will be the same.

import ReorderStartEndEvents from '@site/static/usage/v8/reorder/reorder-start-end-events/index.md';

<ReorderStartEndEvents />

### Using `ionReorderMove`

The `ionReorderMove` event is emitted continuously during the reorder gesture as the user drags an item. The event includes the `from` and `to` indices of the item. Unlike `ionReorderEnd`, the `from` index in this event represents the last known position of the item (which updates as the item moves), while the `to` index represents its current position. If the item has not changed position since the last event, the `from` and `to` indices will be the same. This event is useful for tracking position changes during the drag operation. For example, the ranking or numbering of items can be updated in real-time as they are being dragged to maintain a logical ascending order.

:::warning
Do not call the `complete` method during the `ionReorderMove` event as it can break the gesture.
:::

import ReorderMoveEvent from '@site/static/usage/v8/reorder/reorder-move-event/index.md';

<ReorderMoveEvent />

## Usage with Virtual Scroll

Reorder requires a scroll container to work properly. When using a virtual scrolling solution, a custom scroll target needs to be provided. Scrolling on the content needs to be disabled and the `.ion-content-scroll-host` class needs to be added to the element responsible for scrolling.

import CustomScrollTarget from '@site/static/usage/v8/reorder/custom-scroll-target/index.md';

  <title>ion-ripple-effect: Ripple Effect Component for Ionic Apps</title>
  <meta name="description" content="The ripple effect button component adds the Material Design ink ripple interaction effect. It can only be used in an ion-app and can be added to any component." />
</head>

<EncapsulationPill type="shadow" />


The ripple effect component adds the [Material Design ink ripple interaction effect](https://material.io/develop/web/supporting/ripple). This component can only be used inside of an `<ion-app>` and can be added inside of any element.

It's important to set [relative positioning](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/position) on the parent element because the ripple effect is absolutely positioned and will cover its closest parent that has relative positioning. The parent element should also be given the `ion-activatable` class, which tells the ripple effect that the element is clickable. It's recommended to add `overflow: hidden` to the parent element if the ripple is overflowing its container.


## Basic Usage

import Basic from '@site/static/usage/v8/ripple-effect/basic/index.md';

<Basic />


## Type

There are two types of ripple effects: `"bounded"` and `"unbounded"`. The default type, `"bounded"`, will expand the ripple effect from the click position outwards. To add a ripple effect that always starts in the center of the element and expands in a circle, set the type to `"unbounded"`.

import Type from '@site/static/usage/v8/ripple-effect/type/index.md';

<Type />


## Customizing

The ripple can be customized to a different color through CSS. By default the ripple color is set to inherit the text color, which is generally the body color. This can be changed by setting the CSS `color` on the parent or the ripple effect itself.

</head>

import EncapsulationPill from '@components/page/api/EncapsulationPill';


A route redirect can only be used with an `ion-router` as a direct child of it.

:::note
 Note: this component should only be used with vanilla and Stencil JavaScript projects. For Angular projects, use [`ion-router-outlet`](router-outlet.md) and the Angular router.
:::


The route redirect has two configurable properties:
 - `from`
 - `to`

It redirects "from" a URL "to" another URL. When the defined `ion-route-redirect` rule matches, the router will redirect from the path specified in the `from` property to the path in the `to` property. In order for a redirect to occur the `from` path needs to be an exact match to the navigated URL.


## Multiple Route Redirects

An arbitrary number of redirect routes can be defined inside an `ion-router`, but only one can match.

A route redirect will never call another redirect after its own redirect, since this could lead to infinite loops.

Take the following two redirects:

```html
<ion-router>
  <ion-route-redirect from="/admin" to="/login"></ion-route-redirect>
  <ion-route-redirect from="/login" to="/admin"></ion-route-redirect>
</ion-router>
```

If the user navigates to `/admin` the router will redirect to `/login` and stop there. It will never evaluate more than one redirect.




## Usage

```html
<!-- Redirects when the user navigates to `/admin` but
will NOT redirect if the user navigates to `/admin/posts` -->
<ion-route-redirect from="/admin" to="/login"></ion-route-redirect>

<!-- By adding the wilcard character (*), the redirect will match
any subpath of admin -->
<ion-route-redirect from="/admin/*" to="/login"></ion-route-redirect>
```

### Route Redirects as Guards

Redirection routes can work as guards to prevent users from navigating to certain areas of an application based on a given condition, such as if the user is authenticated or not.

A route redirect can be added and removed dynamically to redirect (or guard) some routes from being accessed. In the following example, all urls `*` will be redirected to the `/login` url if `isLoggedIn` is `false`.

```tsx
const isLoggedIn = false;

const router = document.querySelector('ion-router');
const routeRedirect = document.createElement('ion-route-redirect');
routeRedirect.setAttribute('from', '*');
routeRedirect.setAttribute('to', '/login');

if (!isLoggedIn) {
  router.appendChild(routeRedirect);
}
```

Alternatively, the value of `to` can be modified based on a condition. In the following example, the route redirect will check if the user is logged in and redirect to the `/login` url if not.

```html
<ion-route-redirect id="tutorialRedirect" from="*"></ion-route-redirect>
```

```javascript
const isLoggedIn = false;
const routeRedirect = document.querySelector('#tutorialRedirect');

routeRedirect.setAttribute('to', isLoggedIn ? undefined : '/login');
```

## Navigation Hooks

Navigation hooks can be used to perform tasks or act as navigation guards. Hooks are used by providing functions to the `beforeEnter` and `beforeLeave` properties on each `ion-route`. Returning `true` allows navigation to proceed, while returning `false` causes it to be cancelled. Returning an object of type `NavigationHookOptions` allows you to redirect navigation to another page.

## Interfaces

```typescript
interface NavigationHookOptions {
  /**
   * A valid path to redirect navigation to.
   */
  redirect: string;
}
```

The router outlet behaves in a similar way to Angular's built-in router outlet component and Vue's router view component, but contains the logic for providing a stacked navigation, and animating views in and out.

Although router outlet has methods for navigating around, it's recommended to use the navigation methods in your framework's router.

## Life Cycle Hooks

Routes rendered in a Router Outlet have access to specific Ionic events that are wired up to animations


| Event Name         | Trigger                                                            |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `ionViewWillEnter` | Fired when the component routing to is about to animate into view. |
| `ionViewDidEnter`  | Fired when the component routing to has finished animating.        |
| `ionViewWillLeave` | Fired when the component routing from is about to animate.         |
| `ionViewDidLeave`  | Fired when the component routing to has finished animating.        |


These event tie into Ionic's animation system and can be used to coordinate parts of your app when a Components is done with its animation. These events are not a replacement for your framework's own event system, but an addition.

For handling Router Guards, the older `ionViewCanEnter` and `ionViewCanLeave` have been replaced with their framework specific equivalent. For Angular, there are [Router Guards](https://angular.io/guide/router#milestone-5-route-guards).

</head>

import EncapsulationPill from '@components/page/api/EncapsulationPill';



The router is a component for handling routing inside vanilla and Stencil JavaScript projects.

:::note
 Note: This component should only be used with vanilla and Stencil JavaScript projects. See the routing guides for [Angular](../angular/navigation), [React](../react/navigation), and [Vue](../vue/navigation) for framework-specific routing solutions.
:::


Apps should have a single `ion-router` component in the codebase.
This component controls all interactions with the browser history and it aggregates updates through an event system.

`ion-router` is just a URL coordinator for the navigation outlets of ionic: `ion-nav`, `ion-tabs`, and `ion-router-outlet`.

That means the `ion-router` never touches the DOM, it does NOT show the components or emit any kind of lifecycle events, it just tells `ion-nav`, `ion-tabs`, and `ion-router-outlet` what and when to "show" based on the browser's URL.

In order to configure this relationship between components (to load/select) and URLs, `ion-router` uses a declarative syntax using JSX/HTML to define a tree of routes.

## Basic Usage

import BasicExample from '@site/static/usage/v8/router/basic/index.md';

<BasicExample />

## Interfaces

### RouterEventDetail

```typescript
interface RouterEventDetail {
  from: string | null;
  redirectedFrom: string | null;
  to: string;
}
```

### RouterCustomEvent

While not required, this interface can be used in place of the `CustomEvent` interface for stronger typing with Ionic events emitted from this component.

```typescript
interface RouterCustomEvent extends CustomEvent {
  detail: RouterEventDetail;
  target: HTMLIonRouterElement;
}
```



## Usage

```html
<ion-router>
  <ion-route component="page-tabs">
    <ion-route url="/schedule" component="tab-schedule">
      <ion-route component="page-schedule"></ion-route>
      <ion-route url="/session/:sessionId" component="page-session"></ion-route>

      <ion-route url="/:speakerId" component="page-speaker-detail"></ion-route>
    </ion-route>

    <ion-route url="/map" component="page-map"></ion-route>

Rows are horizontal components of the [grid](./grid) system and contain varying numbers of
[columns](./col). They ensure the columns are positioned properly.

See the [grid](./grid) documentation for more information.


## Row Alignment

By default, columns will stretch to fill the entire height of the row and wrap when necessary. Rows are [flex containers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Flex_Container), so there are several [CSS classes](/docs/layout/css-utilities#flex-container-properties) that can be applied to a row to customize this behavior.

</head>

import EncapsulationPill from '@components/page/api/EncapsulationPill';

<EncapsulationPill type="scoped" />

Searchbars represent a text field that can be used to search through a collection. They can be displayed inside of a toolbar or the main content. A searchbar should be used instead of an input to search lists.


## Basic Usage

import Basic from '@site/static/usage/v8/searchbar/basic/index.md';

<Basic />


## Search Icon

A search icon is displayed to the left of the input field in a searchbar. It can be customized to any [Ionicon](https://ionic.io/ionicons/).

import SearchIcon from '@site/static/usage/v8/searchbar/search-icon/index.md';

<SearchIcon />


## Clear Button

A clear button is displayed when a searchbar has a value or upon entering input in the searchbar's text field. Clicking on the clear button will erase the text field and the input will remain focused. By default, the clear button is set to show when focusing the searchbar, but it can be set to always show or never show. The icon inside of the clear button can also be customized to any [Ionicon](https://ionic.io/ionicons/).

import ClearButton from '@site/static/usage/v8/searchbar/clear-button/index.md';

<ClearButton />


## Cancel Button

A cancel button can be enabled which will clear the input and lose the focus upon click. By default, cancel buttons are set to never show, but they can be set to always show or only show when focusing the searchbar. The cancel button is displayed as text in `ios` mode, and as an icon in `md` mode. Both the text and icon can be customized using different properties, with the icon accepting any [Ionicon](https://ionic.io/ionicons/).

import CancelButton from '@site/static/usage/v8/searchbar/cancel-button/index.md';

<CancelButton />


## Searchbars in Toolbars

Searchbars are styled to look native when placed inside of a toolbar. In iOS, searchbars should be placed in their own toolbar, under a toolbar that contains the page title. In Material Design, searchbars are either persistently displayed in their own toolbar, or expand over a toolbar containing the page title.

<!-- Reuse the playground from the Toolbar directory -->
import Toolbar from '@site/static/usage/v8/toolbar/searchbars/index.md';

<Toolbar />


## Debounce

A debounce can be set on the searchbar in order to delay triggering the `ionInput` event. This is useful when querying data, as it can be used to wait to make a request instead of requesting the data each time a character is entered in the input.

import Debounce from '@site/static/usage/v8/searchbar/debounce/index.md';

<Debounce />


## Theming

### Colors

import Colors from '@site/static/usage/v8/searchbar/theming/colors/index.md';

<Colors />

### CSS Custom Properties

Searchbar uses scoped encapsulation, which means it will automatically scope its CSS by appending each of the styles with an additional class at runtime. Overriding scoped selectors in CSS requires a [higher specificity](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Specificity) selector. Targeting the `ion-searchbar` for customization will not work, therefore we recommend adding a class and customizing it that way.

import CSSProps from '@site/static/usage/v8/searchbar/theming/css-properties/index.md';

<CSSProps />


## Keyboard Display

### Android

By default, tapping the input will cause the keyboard to appear with a magnifying glass icon on the submit button. You can optionally set the `inputmode` property to `"search"`, which will change the icon from a magnifying glass to a carriage return.

### iOS

By default, tapping the input will cause the keyboard to appear with the text "return" on a gray submit button. You can optionally set the `inputmode` property to `"search"`, which will change the text from "return" to "go", and change the button color from gray to blue. Alternatively, you can wrap the `ion-searchbar` in a `form` element with an `action` property. This will cause the keyboard to appear with a blue submit button that says "search".

Segment buttons are groups of related buttons inside of a [segment](segment.md). They are displayed in a horizontal row. A segment button can be selected by default by setting the `value` of the segment to the `value` of the segment button. Only one segment button can be selected at a time.


## Basic Usage

import Basic from '@site/static/usage/v8/segment-button/basic/index.md';

<Basic />


## Layout

The `layout` property is set to `"icon-top"` by default. When a segment button has both an icon and a label, it will display the icon on top of the label. This behavior can be changed by setting the `layout` property to `"icon-bottom"`, `"icon-start"`, or `"icon-end"` which will show the icon below the label, to the start of the label (left in LTR and right in RTL) or to the end of the label (right in LTR and left in RTL), respectively.

Segment content is a wrapper element used to control the display of child elements when using swipeable segments. Segment content elements are children of a single
[segment view](./segment-view.md) instance that is linked to a [segment](./segment.md). See our [swipeable segments](./segment.md#swipeable-segments) documentation
for more information on how to use segment contents.

## Usage

Each `ion-segment-content` needs a unique `id` attribute. This will be used to link the segment content to a segment button via the button's
[contentId property](./segment-button.md#properties).

  <title>ion-segment: API Documentation for Segmented Controls</title>
  <meta name="description" content="ion-segments display a group of related buttons—sometimes known as segmented controls. View our Segment API Documentation to learn more about usage." />
</head>

import EncapsulationPill from '@components/page/api/EncapsulationPill';

<EncapsulationPill type="shadow" />


Segments display a group of related buttons, sometimes known as segmented controls, in a horizontal row. They can be displayed inside of a toolbar or the main content.

Their functionality is similar to tabs, where selecting one will deselect all others. Segments are useful for toggling between different views inside of the content. Tabs should be used instead of a segment when clicking on a control should navigate between pages.


## Basic Usage

Segments consist of [segment buttons](./segment-button) with a `value` property on each button. Set the `value` property on the segment to match the value of a button to select that button. Segments can also be disabled to prevent users from interacting with them.

import Basic from '@site/static/usage/v8/segment/basic/index.md';

<Basic />


## Scrollable Segments

Segments are not scrollable by default. Each segment button has a fixed width, and the width is determined by dividing the number of segment buttons by the screen width. This ensures that each segment button can be displayed on the screen without having to scroll. As a result, some segment buttons with longer labels may get cut off. To avoid this we recommend either using a shorter label or switching to a scrollable segment by setting the `scrollable` property to `true`. This will cause the segment to scroll horizontally, but will allow each segment button to have a variable width.

import Scrollable from '@site/static/usage/v8/segment/scrollable/index.md';

<Scrollable />


## Segments in Toolbars

<!-- Reuse the playground from the Toolbar directory -->
import Toolbar from '@site/static/usage/v8/toolbar/segments/index.md';

<Toolbar />


## Swipeable Segments

Each [segment button](./segment-button.md) can be associated with a [segment content](./segment-content.md) element that will be displayed
when the segment is active. With this approach, each segment's content can be swiped or scrolled between and the segment will be updated
to reflect the currently visible content.

:::warning
If no initial `value` is assigned to the `ion-segment` when using swipeable segments, the segment will default to the value of the first segment button.

Segment buttons cannot be disabled when used with swipeable segments.

### Keyboard Interactions

The component has full keyboard support for navigating between and selecting `ion-segment-button` elements. By default, keyboard navigation will only focus `ion-segment-button` elements, but you can use the `selectOnFocus` property to ensure that they get selected on focus as well. The following table details what each key does:

| Key                                  | Description                                    |

| <kbd>ArrowLeft</kbd>                 | Focuses the previous focusable element.        |
| <kbd>Home</kbd>                      | Focuses the first focusable element.           |
| <kbd>End</kbd>                       | Focuses the last focusable element.            |
| <kbd>Space</kbd> or <kbd>Enter</kbd> | Selects the element that is currently focused. |

</head>

import EncapsulationPill from '@components/page/api/EncapsulationPill';

<EncapsulationPill type="shadow" />


Selects are form controls to select an option, or options, from a set of options. When a user taps the select, a dialog appears with all of the options in a large, easy to select list.

A select should be used with child `<ion-select-option>` elements. If the child option is not given a `value` attribute then its text will be used as the value.

If `value` is set on the `<ion-select>`, the selected option will be chosen based on that value.

## Labels

Labels should be used to describe the select. They can be used visually, and they will also be read out by screen readers when the user is focused on the select. This makes it easy for the user to understand the intent of the select. Select has several ways to assign a label:

Select has several options for supplying a label for the component:

- `label` property: used for plaintext labels
- `label` slot: used for custom HTML labels
- `aria-label`: used to provide a label for screen readers but adds no visible label

### Label Placement

Labels will take up the width of their content by default. Developers can use the `labelPlacement` property to control how the label is placed relative to the control. While the `label` property is used here, `labelPlacement` can also be used with the `label` slot.

import LabelPlacement from '@site/static/usage/v8/select/label-placement/index.md';

<LabelPlacement />

### Label Slot

While plaintext labels should be passed in via the `label` property, if custom HTML is needed, it can be passed through the `label` slot instead.

import LabelSlot from '@site/static/usage/v8/select/label-slot/index.md';

<LabelSlot />

### No Visible Label

If no visible label is needed, developers should still supply an `aria-label` so the select is accessible to screen readers.

import NoVisibleLabel from '@site/static/usage/v8/select/no-visible-label/index.md';

<NoVisibleLabel />

## Single Selection

By default, the select allows the user to select only one option. The alert interface presents users with a radio button styled list of options. The select component's value receives the value of the selected option's value.

Keyboard interactions for single selection are described in the [Keyboard Interactions](#single-selection-1) section below.

import SingleSelectionExample from '@site/static/usage/v8/select/basic/single-selection/index.md';

<SingleSelectionExample />

## Multiple Selection

By adding the `multiple` attribute to select, users are able to select multiple options. When multiple options can be selected, the alert, popover, or modal overlay presents users with a checkbox styled list of options. The select component's value receives an array of all of the selected option values.

:::note

The `action-sheet` interface is not supported with multiple selection.

:::

Keyboard interactions for multiple selection are described in the [Keyboard Interactions](#multiple-selection-1) section below.

import MultipleSelectionExample from '@site/static/usage/v8/select/basic/multiple-selection/index.md';

<MultipleSelectionExample />

## Interfaces

By default, select uses [ion-alert](alert.md) to open up the overlay of options in an alert. The interface can be changed to use [ion-action-sheet](action-sheet.md), [ion-popover](popover.md), or [ion-modal](modal.md) by passing `action-sheet`, `popover`, or `modal`, respectively, to the `interface` property. Read on to the other sections for the limitations of the different interfaces.

### Alert

import AlertExample from '@site/static/usage/v8/select/basic/single-selection/index.md';

<AlertExample />


### Action Sheet

import ActionSheetExample from '@site/static/usage/v8/select/interfaces/action-sheet/index.md';

<ActionSheetExample />

### Popover

import PopoverExample from '@site/static/usage/v8/select/interfaces/popover/index.md';

<PopoverExample />

### Modal

import ModalExample from '@site/static/usage/v8/select/interfaces/modal/index.md';

<ModalExample />

## Responding to Interaction

The main ways of handling user interaction with the select are the `ionChange`, `ionDismiss`, and `ionCancel` events. See [Events](#events) for more details on these and other events that select fires.

import RespondingToInteractionExample from '@site/static/usage/v8/select/basic/responding-to-interaction/index.md';

<RespondingToInteractionExample />

## Object Value References

When using objects for select values, it is possible for the identities of these objects to change if they are coming from a server or database, while the selected value's identity remains the same. For example, this can occur when an existing record with the desired object value is loaded into the select, but the newly retrieved select options now have different identities. This will result in the select appearing to have no value at all, even though the original selection in still intact.

By default, the select uses strict equality (`===`) to determine if an option is selected. This can be overridden by providing a property name or a function to the `compareWith` property.

### Using compareWith

import UsingCompareWithExample from '@site/static/usage/v8/select/objects-as-values/using-comparewith/index.md';

<UsingCompareWithExample />

### Object Values and Multiple Selection

import ObjectValuesAndMultipleSelectionExample from '@site/static/usage/v8/select/objects-as-values/multiple-selection/index.md';

<ObjectValuesAndMultipleSelectionExample />

## Justification

Developers can use the `justify` property to control how the label and control are packed on a line.

import JustifyExample from '@site/static/usage/v8/select/justify/index.md';

<JustifyExample />

## Filled Selects

Material Design offers filled styles for a select. The `fill` property on the select can be set to either `"solid"` or `"outline"`.

Filled selects can be used on iOS by setting the select's `mode` to `md`.

:::warning
Selects that use `fill` should not be used in an `ion-item` due to styling conflicts between the components.
:::

import FillExample from '@site/static/usage/v8/select/fill/index.md';

<FillExample />

## Select Buttons

The alert supports two buttons: `Cancel` and `OK`. Each button's text can be customized using the `cancelText` and `okText` properties.

The `action-sheet` and `popover` interfaces do not have an `OK` button, clicking on any of the options will automatically close the overlay and select that value. The `popover` interface does not have a `Cancel` button, clicking on the backdrop will close the overlay.

The `modal` interface has a single `Close` button in the header. This button is only responsible for dismissing the modal. Any selections made will persist
after clicking this button or if the modal is dismissed using an alternative method.

import ButtonTextExample from '@site/static/usage/v8/select/customization/button-text/index.md';

<ButtonTextExample />

## Interface Options

Since select uses the alert, action sheet, popover, and modal interfaces, options can be passed to these components through the `interfaceOptions` property. This can be used to pass a custom header, subheader, css class, and more.

See the [ion-alert docs](alert.md), [ion-action-sheet docs](action-sheet.md), [ion-popover docs](popover.md), and [ion-modal docs](modal.md)
for the properties that each interface accepts.

Note: `interfaceOptions` will not override `inputs` or `buttons` with the `alert` interface.

import InterfaceOptionsExample from '@site/static/usage/v8/select/customization/interface-options/index.md';

<InterfaceOptionsExample />

## Start and End Slots

The `start` and `end` slots can be used to place icons, buttons, or prefix/suffix text on either side of the select. If the slot content is clicked, the select will not open.

:::note
In most cases, [Icon](./icon.md) components placed in these slots should have `aria-hidden="true"`. See the [Icon accessibility docs](https://ionicframework.com/docs/api/icon#accessibility) for more information.

If slot content is meant to be interacted with, it should be wrapped in an interactive element such as a [Button](./button.md). This ensures that the content can be tabbed to.
:::

import StartEndSlots from '@site/static/usage/v8/select/start-end-slots/index.md';

<StartEndSlots />

## Customization

There are two units that make up the Select component and each need to be styled separately. The `ion-select` element is represented on the view by the selected value(s), or placeholder if there is none, and dropdown icon. The interface, which is defined in the [Interfaces](#interfaces) section above, is the dialog that opens when clicking on the `ion-select`. The interface contains all of the options defined by adding `ion-select-option` elements. The following sections will go over the differences between styling these.

### Styling Select Element

As mentioned, the `ion-select` element consists only of the value(s), or placeholder, and icon that is displayed on the view. To customize this, style using a combination of CSS and any of the [CSS custom properties](#css-custom-properties).

Alternatively, depending on the [browser support](https://caniuse.com/#feat=mdn-css_selectors_part) needed, CSS shadow parts can be used to style the select. Notice that by using `::part`, any CSS property on the element can be targeted.

import StylingSelectExample from '@site/static/usage/v8/select/customization/styling-select/index.md';

<StylingSelectExample />

### Styling Select Interface

Customizing the interface dialog should be done by following the styling sections (CSS shadow parts, CSS custom properties, and slots) in
that interface's documentation:

- [Alert](alert.md#css-shadow-parts)
- [Action Sheet](action-sheet.md#css-shadow-parts)
- [Popover](popover.md#css-shadow-parts)
- [Modal](modal.md#css-shadow-parts)

However, the Select Option does set a class for easier styling and allows for the ability to pass a class to the overlay option, see the [Select Options documentation](select-option.md) for usage examples of customizing options.

### Custom Toggle Icons

The icon that displays next to the select text can be set to any [Ionicon](https://ionic.io/ionicons) using the `toggleIcon` and/or `expandedIcon` properties.

import CustomToggleIconsExample from '@site/static/usage/v8/select/customization/custom-toggle-icons/index.md';

<CustomToggleIconsExample />

### Icon Flip Behavior

By default, when the select is open, the toggle icon will automatically rotate on `md` mode and remain static on `ios` mode. This behavior can be customized using CSS.

The below example also uses a [custom `toggleIcon`](#custom-toggle-icons) to better demonstrate the flip behavior on `ios`, since the default icon is vertically symmetrical.

import IconFlipBehaviorExample from '@site/static/usage/v8/select/customization/icon-flip-behavior/index.md';

<IconFlipBehaviorExample />

## Typeahead Component

Typeahead or autocomplete functionality can be built using existing Ionic components. We recommend using an `ion-modal` to make the best use of the available screen space.

import TypeaheadExample from '@site/static/usage/v8/select/typeahead/index.md';

<TypeaheadExample />

## Helper & Error Text

Helper and error text can be used inside of a select with the `helperText` and `errorText` property. The error text will not be displayed unless the `ion-invalid` and `ion-touched` classes are added to the `ion-select`. This ensures errors are not shown before the user has a chance to enter data.

In Angular, this is done automatically through form validation. In JavaScript, React and Vue, the class needs to be manually added based on your own validation.

import HelperError from '@site/static/usage/v8/select/helper-error/index.md';

<HelperError />

## Interfaces

### SelectChangeEventDetail

```typescript
interface SelectChangeEventDetail<T = any> {
  value: T;
}
```

### SelectCustomEvent

While not required, this interface can be used in place of the `CustomEvent` interface for stronger typing with Ionic events emitted from this component.

```typescript
interface SelectCustomEvent<T = any> extends CustomEvent {
  detail: SelectChangeEventDetail<T>;
  target: HTMLIonSelectElement;
}
```

## Accessibility

### Keyboard Interactions

Ionic's keyboard interactions follow the implementation patterns of the web instead of the native iOS select for a consistent experience across all platforms.

These keyboard interactions apply to all `ion-select` elements when the following conditions are met:
- The select is closed.
- The select is focused.
- The select is not disabled.

| Key                | Description                                                  |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| <kbd>Enter</kbd>   | Opens the overlay and focuses on the first selected option. If there is no selected option, then it focuses on the first option. |
| <kbd>Space</kbd>   | Opens the overlay and focuses on the first selected option. If there is no selected option, then it focuses on the first option. |

#### Single Selection

Single selection keyboard interaction follows the [ARIA implementation patterns of a radio](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/radio/).

These keyboard interactions apply to `ion-action-sheet`, `ion-alert`, `ion-popover`, and `ion-modal` elements when the overlay is presented and focused.

| Key                   | Description                                                  |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| <kbd>ArrowDown</kbd>  | Focuses and selects the next option in the list. If there is no next option, selection will cycle to the first option. |
| <kbd>ArrowLeft</kbd>  | Focuses and selects the previous option in the list. If there is no previous option, selection will cycle to the last option. |
| <kbd>ArrowRight</kbd> | Focuses and selects the next option in the list. If there is no next option, selection will cycle to the first option. |
| <kbd>ArrowUp</kbd>    | Focuses and selects the previous option in the list. If there is no previous option, selection will cycle to the last option. |
| <kbd>Enter</kbd>      | If an option is focused, it will select the option. Overlays **without** an 'OK' button will commit the value immediately, dismiss the overlay and return focus to the `ion-select` element.<br /><br/>If the 'OK' button is focused, it will save the user's selection, dismiss the overlay and return focus to the `ion-select` element. |
| <kbd>Escape</kbd>     | Closes the overlay without changing the submitted option. Returns the focus back to the `ion-select` element. |
| <kbd>Space</kbd>      | If the focused radio button is not checked, unchecks the currently checked radio button and checks the focused radio button. Otherwise, does nothing. If the overlay does not have an 'OK' button, the value will be committed immediately and the overlay will dismiss. |
| <kbd>Tab</kbd>        | Moves focus to the next focusable element (cancel button, 'OK' button, or either the selection or the first option) on the overlay. If the next focusable element is an option, then it will focus on the selected option, otherwise it will focus the first option. |

#### Multiple Selection

Multiple selection keyboard interaction follows the [ARIA implementation patterns of a checkbox](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/checkbox/).

These keyboard interactions apply to `ion-alert`, `ion-popover`, and `ion-modal` elements when the overlay is presented and multiple selection is enabled.

| Key                | Description                                                  |

| <kbd>Enter</kbd>   | When the 'OK' button is focused, it will save the user's selection, dismiss the overlay, and return focus to the `ion-select` element. |
| <kbd>Escape</kbd>  | Closes the overlay without changing the submitted option(s). Returns the focus back to the `ion-select` element. |
| <kbd>Space</kbd>   | Selects or deselects the currently focused option. This does not deselect the other selected options. If the overlay does not have an 'OK' button, the value will be committed immediately. |
| <kbd>Tab</kbd>     | Move focus to the next focusable element (cancel button, 'OK' button, or any of the options) on the overlay. If the next focusable element is the options list, then it should iterate through each option. |

<EncapsulationPill type="shadow" />


The Spinner component provides a variety of animated SVG spinners. Spinners are visual indicators that the app is loading content or performing another process that the user needs to wait on.


## Basic Usage

The default spinner is based on the mode. When the mode is `ios` the spinner will be `"lines"`, and when the mode is `md` the spinner will be `"circular"`. If the `name` property is set, then that spinner will be used instead of the mode specific spinner.

  <title>ion-split-pane: Split Plane for Menus and Multi-View Layouts</title>
  <meta name="description" content="ion-split-pane is useful when creating multi-view app layouts. It allows UI elements, like menus, to be displayed as the viewport width increases." />
</head>

import EncapsulationPill from '@components/page/api/EncapsulationPill';

<EncapsulationPill type="shadow" />

A split pane is useful when creating multi-view layouts. It allows UI elements, like menus, to be
displayed as the viewport width increases.

If the device's screen width is below a certain size, the split pane will collapse and the menu will be hidden. This is ideal for creating an app that will be served in a browser and deployed through the app store to phones and tablets.

## Basic Usage

:::note
This demo sets the `when` property to `'xs'` so the split pane always shows up. Your Ionic application does not need this if you want the split pane to collapse on smaller viewports. See [Setting Breakpoints](#setting-breakpoints) for more information. 
:::

import Basic from '@site/static/usage/v8/split-pane/basic/index.md';

<Basic />

## Setting Breakpoints

By default, the split pane will expand when the screen is larger than 992px. To customize this, pass a breakpoint in the `when` property. The `when` property can accept a boolean value, any valid media query, or one of Ionic's predefined sizes.


```html
<!-- can be "xs", "sm", "md", "lg", or "xl" -->
<ion-split-pane when="md"></ion-split-pane>

<!-- can be any valid media query https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries/Using_media_queries -->
<ion-split-pane when="(min-width: 40px)"></ion-split-pane>
```


 | Size | Value                 | Description                                                           |
 |------|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
 | `xs` | `(min-width: 0px)`    | Show the split-pane when the min-width is 0px (meaning, always)       |
 | `sm` | `(min-width: 576px)`  | Show the split-pane when the min-width is 576px                       |
 | `md` | `(min-width: 768px)`  | Show the split-pane when the min-width is 768px                       |
 | `lg` | `(min-width: 992px)`  | Show the split-pane when the min-width is 992px (default break point) |
 | `xl` | `(min-width: 1200px)` | Show the split-pane when the min-width is 1200px                      |

The tab component is a child component of [tabs](tabs.md). Each tab can contain a top level navigation stack for an app or a single view. An app can have many tabs, all with their own independent navigation.

:::note
Angular, React, and Vue can only use this component when the `ion-tabs` component is configured for [basic usage](./tabs.md#basic-usage). When setting up tabs with routing, the `ion-tab` component cannot be used.

In JavaScript, this component can be used with the `ion-tabs` component configured for either [basic usage](./tabs.md#basic-usage) or [usage with router](./tabs.md#usage-with-router).
:::


See the [tabs documentation](tabs.md) for more details on configuring tabs.

</head>

import EncapsulationPill from '@components/page/api/EncapsulationPill';

<EncapsulationPill type="shadow" />

Tabs are a top level navigation component to implement a tab-based navigation.
The component is a container of individual [Tab](tab.md) components.

The `ion-tabs` component does not have any styling and works as a router outlet in order to handle navigation. It does not provide any UI feedback or mechanism to switch between tabs. In order to do so, an `ion-tab-bar` should be provided as a direct child of `ion-tabs`.

Both `ion-tabs` and `ion-tab-bar` can be used as standalone elements. They don’t depend on each other to work, but they are usually used together in order to implement a tab-based navigation that behaves like a native app.

The `ion-tab-bar` needs a slot defined in order to be projected to the right place in an `ion-tabs` component.

## Basic Usage

Tabs can be used to display different content without the need to change the URL. This is useful when the tabs are not used for navigation, but rather to display different content.

import Basic from '@site/static/usage/v8/tabs/basic/index.md';

<Basic />

## Usage with Router

Tabs can be used with the Ionic router to implement tab-based navigation. The tab bar and active tab will automatically resolve based on the URL. This is the most common pattern for tabs navigation.

import Router from '@site/static/usage/v8/tabs/router/index.md';

<Router />

:::tip Best Practices

Ionic has guides on best practices for routing patterns with tabs. Check out the guides for [Angular](/angular/navigation#working-with-tabs), [React](/react/navigation#working-with-tabs), and [Vue](/vue/navigation#working-with-tabs) for additional information.

## Interfaces

### TabsCustomEvent

While not required, this interface can be used in place of the `CustomEvent` interface for stronger typing with Ionic events emitted from this component.

interface TabsCustomEvent extends CustomEvent {
  detail: { tab: string };
  target: HTMLIonTabsElement;
}

  <title>Ionic Textarea Component and CSS Properties for Multi-Line Input</title>
  <meta name="description" content="Textarea is for multi-line input. The component accepts native textarea attributes in addition to Ionic properties. Read to learn about use and CSS elements." />
</head>

import EncapsulationPill from '@components/page/api/EncapsulationPill';

<EncapsulationPill type="scoped" />

The textarea component is used for multi-line text input. A native textarea element is rendered inside of the component. The user experience and interactivity of the textarea component is improved by having control over the native textarea.

Unlike the native textarea element, the Ionic textarea does not support loading its value from the inner content. The textarea value should be set in the `value` attribute.

The textarea component accepts the [native textarea attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/textarea) in addition to the Ionic properties.

## Basic Usage

import BasicPlayground from '@site/static/usage/v8/textarea/basic/index.md';

<BasicPlayground />

## Labels

Labels should be used to describe the textarea. They can be used visually, and they will also be read out by screen readers when the user is focused on the textarea. This makes it easy for the user to understand the intent of the textarea. Textarea has several ways to assign a label:

- `label` property: used for plaintext labels
- `label` slot: used for custom HTML labels (experimental)
- `aria-label`: used to provide a label for screen readers but adds no visible label

### Label Placement

Labels will take up the width of their content by default. Developers can use the `labelPlacement` property to control how the label is placed relative to the control.

import LabelPlacement from '@site/static/usage/v8/textarea/label-placement/index.md';

<LabelPlacement />

### Label Slot (experimental)

While plaintext labels should be passed in via the `label` property, if custom HTML is needed, it can be passed through the `label` slot instead.

Note that this feature is considered experimental because it relies on a simulated version of [Web Component slots](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components/Using_templates_and_slots). As a result, the simulated behavior may not exactly match the native slot behavior.

import LabelSlot from '@site/static/usage/v8/textarea/label-slot/index.md';

<LabelSlot />

### No Visible Label

If no visible label is needed, developers should still supply an `aria-label` so the textarea is accessible to screen readers.

import NoVisibleLabel from '@site/static/usage/v8/textarea/no-visible-label/index.md';

<NoVisibleLabel />

## Filled Textareas

Material Design offers filled styles for a textarea. The `fill` property on the item can be set to either `"solid"` or `"outline"`.

Filled textareas can be used on iOS by setting the textarea's `mode` to `md`.

:::warning
Textareas that use `fill` should not be used in an `ion-item` due to styling conflicts between the components.
:::

import Fill from '@site/static/usage/v8/textarea/fill/index.md';

<Fill />

## Helper & Error Text

Helper and error text can be used inside of a textarea with the `helperText` and `errorText` property. The error text will not be displayed unless the `ion-invalid` and `ion-touched` classes are added to the `ion-textarea`. This ensures errors are not shown before the user has a chance to enter data.

In Angular, this is done automatically through form validation. In JavaScript, React and Vue, the class needs to be manually added based on your own validation.

import HelperError from '@site/static/usage/v8/textarea/helper-error/index.md';

<HelperError />

## Textarea Counter

The textarea counter is text that displays under a textarea to notify the user of how many characters have been entered out of the total that the textarea will accept. When adding counter, the default behavior is to format the value that gets displayed as `inputLength` / `maxLength`. This behavior can be customized by passing in a formatter function to the `counterFormatter` property.

import Counter from '@site/static/usage/v8/textarea/counter/index.md';

<Counter />

## Autogrow

When the `autoGrow` property is set to `true`, the textarea will grow and shrink based on its contents.

import AutogrowPlayground from '@site/static/usage/v8/textarea/autogrow/index.md';

<AutogrowPlayground />

## Clear on Edit

Setting the `clearOnEdit` property to `true` will clear the textarea after it has been blurred and then typed in again.

import ClearOnEditPlayground from '@site/static/usage/v8/textarea/clear-on-edit/index.md';

<ClearOnEditPlayground />

## Start and End Slots (experimental)

The `start` and `end` slots can be used to place icons, buttons, or prefix/suffix text on either side of the textarea.

Note that this feature is considered experimental because it relies on a simulated version of [Web Component slots](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components/Using_templates_and_slots). As a result, the simulated behavior may not exactly match the native slot behavior.

:::note
In most cases, [Icon](./icon.md) components placed in these slots should have `aria-hidden="true"`. See the [Icon accessibility docs](https://ionicframework.com/docs/api/icon#accessibility) for more information.

If slot content is meant to be interacted with, it should be wrapped in an interactive element such as a [Button](./button.md). This ensures that the content can be tabbed to.

Thumbnails are square components that usually wrap an image or icon. They can be used to make it easier to display a group of larger images or provide a preview of the full-size image.

Thumbnails can be used by themselves or inside of any element. If placed inside of an `ion-item`, the thumbnail will resize to fit the parent component. To position a thumbnail on the left or right side of an item, set the slot to `start` or `end`, respectively.

Title is a text component that sets the title for a [toolbar](./toolbar). It can be used to describe the screen or section a user is currently on or the app being used.

## Basic

import Basic from '@site/static/usage/v8/title/basic/index.md';

<Basic />

## Collapsible Large Titles

The large title will display when the [content](./content) is scrolled to the start of the scroll container. When the title is scrolled behind the header, the condensed title will fade in.

:::info

This feature is only available for iOS.

:::

import CollapsibleLargeTitle from '@site/static/usage/v8/title/collapsible-large-title/basic/index.md';

<CollapsibleLargeTitle />

### Collapsible Buttons

The [buttons](./buttons.md) component can be used with the [`collapse`](./buttons.md#collapse) property to additionally display in the header as the toolbar is collapsed.


import CollapsibleLargeTitleButtons from '@site/static/usage/v8/title/collapsible-large-title/buttons/index.md';

<CollapsibleLargeTitleButtons />

## Accessibility

### Headings

When creating headings, we typically recommend using [semantic heading elements (h1-h6)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Heading_Elements). However, there may be instances where you need to update Title to be treated as a particular heading by assistive technologies. For example, if you have a Title at the top of a view, you may want this to be considered a level 1 heading.

To achieve this, developers should use the [`heading` role](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/heading_role) on Title. This will indicate to assistive technologies that Title is a type of heading. From there, developers should use the [`aria-level` attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-level) to set the heading level.

For example, if we wanted to make a Title behave like an `h1` element, we would set `role="heading"` and `aria-level="1"` on the Title. This is necessary when using the [Focus Manager](../developing/managing-focus#assistive-technology-focus-management).

Since multiple Title elements can be used on a view in conjunction with semantic heading elements, Ionic does not automatically set the Title's `role` or `aria-level`. It is the responsibility of the developer to handle this.

## Theming

The collapsible large title should appear seamless in relation to the rest of your content. This means that the background color of the toolbar containing the collapsible large title should always match the background color of the content.

By default, the toolbar that contains the standard title is hidden using `opacity: 0` and is progressively shown as you collapse the large title by scrolling. As a result, the background color that you see behind the standard title is actually the background color of the content.

You can change the background color of the toolbar with the standard title by setting the `--background` CSS variable. This will give the effect of the header changing color as you collapse the large title.

When styling the text color of the large title, you should target the large title globally as opposed to within the context of a particular page or tab, otherwise its styles will not be applied during the navigation animation.

  <title>ion-toast: A Dismissible App Notification Alert Component</title>
  <meta name="description" content="ion-toast component is an app notification displaying system messages or feedback. Toast alerts appear above content and are dismissed to resume interaction." />
</head>

import EncapsulationPill from '@components/page/api/EncapsulationPill';

<EncapsulationPill type="shadow" />

A Toast is a subtle notification commonly used in modern applications. It can be used to provide feedback about an operation or to display a system message. The toast appears on top of the app's content, and can be dismissed by the app to resume user interaction with the app.

## Inline Toasts (Recommended)

`ion-toast` can be used by writing the component directly in your template. This reduces the number of handlers you need to wire up in order to present the toast.

import InlineToastTriggerExample from '@site/static/usage/v8/toast/inline/basic/index.md';

<InlineToastTriggerExample />

### Using `isOpen​`

The `isOpen` property on `ion-toast` allows developers to control the presentation state of the toast from their application state. This means when `isOpen` is set to `true` the toast will be presented and when `isOpen` is set to `false` the toast will be dismissed.

`isOpen` uses a one-way data binding, meaning it will not automatically be set to `false` when the toast is dismissed. Developers should listen for the `ionToastDidDismiss` or `didDismiss` event and set `isOpen` to `false`. The reason for this is it prevents the internals of `ion-toast` from being tightly coupled with the state of the application. With a one way data binding, the toast only needs to concern itself with the boolean value that the reactive variable provides. With a two way data binding, the toast needs to concern itself with both the boolean value as well as the existence of the reactive variable itself. This can lead to non-deterministic behaviors and make applications harder to debug.

import InlineToastIsOpenExample from '@site/static/usage/v8/toast/inline/is-open/index.md';

<InlineToastIsOpenExample />

## Controller Toasts

import ControllerExample from '@site/static/usage/v8/toast/presenting/controller/index.md';

<ControllerExample />

## Dismissing

Toasts are intended to be subtle notifications and should not interrupt the user. As a result, user interaction should not be required to dismiss the toast.

The toast can be dismissed automatically after a specific amount of time by passing the number of milliseconds to display it in the `duration` of the toast options. If a button with a role of `"cancel"` is added, then that button will dismiss the toast. To dismiss the toast after creation, call the `dismiss()` method on the instance.

Pressing the hardware back button does not dismiss toasts since they are not supposed to interrupt the user.

The following example demonstrates how to use the `buttons` property to add a button that automatically dismisses the toast when clicked, as well as how to collect the `role` of the dismiss event.

import ButtonsPlayground from '@site/static/usage/v8/toast/buttons/index.md';

<ButtonsPlayground />

## Positioning

Toasts can be positioned at the top, bottom or middle of the viewport. The position can be passed upon creation. The possible values are `top`, `bottom` and `middle`. If the position is not specified, the toast will be displayed at the bottom of the viewport.

### Relative Positioning

If a toast is presented alongside navigation elements such as a header, footer, or [FAB](./fab.md), the toast may overlap these elements by default. This can be fixed using the `positionAnchor` property, which takes either an element reference or an ID. The toast will be positioned relative to the chosen element, appearing below it when using `position="top"` or above it when using `position="bottom"`. When using `position="middle"`, the `positionAnchor` property is ignored.

import PositionAnchor from '@site/static/usage/v8/toast/position-anchor/index.md';

<PositionAnchor />

## Swipe to Dismiss

Toasts can be swiped to dismiss by using the `swipeGesture` property. This feature is position-aware, meaning the direction that users need to swipe will change based on the value of the `position` property. Additionally, the distance users need to swipe may be impacted by the `positionAnchor` property.

import SwipeGesture from '@site/static/usage/v8/toast/swipe-gesture/index.md';

<SwipeGesture />

## Layout

Button containers within the toast can be displayed either on the same line as the message or stacked on separate lines using the `layout` property. The stacked layout should be used with buttons that have long text values. Additionally, buttons in a stacked toast layout can use a `side` value of either `start` or `end`, but not both.

import StackedPlayground from '@site/static/usage/v8/toast/layout/index.md';

<StackedPlayground />

## Icons

An icon can be added next to the content inside of the toast. In general, icons in toasts should be used to add additional style or context, not to grab the user's attention or elevate the priority of the toast. If you wish to convey a higher priority message to the user or guarantee a response, we recommend using an [Alert](alert.md) instead.

import IconPlayground from '@site/static/usage/v8/toast/icon/index.md';

<IconPlayground />

## Theming

import ThemingPlayground from '@site/static/usage/v8/toast/theming/index.md';

<ThemingPlayground />

## Accessibility

### Focus Management

Toasts are intended to be subtle notifications and are not intended to interrupt the user. User interaction should not be required to dismiss the toast. As a result, focus is not automatically moved to a toast when one is presented.

### Screen Readers

Toasts set aria properties in order to be [accessible](../reference/glossary#a11y) to screen readers, but these properties can be overridden if they aren't descriptive enough or don't align with how the toast is being used in an app.

#### Role

`ion-toast` has `role="status"` and `aria-live="polite"` set on the inner `.toast-content` element. This causes screen readers to only announce the toast message and header. Buttons and icons will not be announced when the toast is presented.

`aria-live` causes screen readers to announce the content of the toast when it is updated. However, since the attribute is set to `'polite'`, screen readers should not interrupt the current task.

Since toasts are intended to be subtle notification, `aria-live` should never be set to `"assertive"`. If developers need to interrupt the user with an important message, we recommend using an [alert](./alert).

#### Toast Buttons Description

Buttons containing text will be read by a screen reader when they are interacted with. If a button contains only an icon, or a description other than the existing text is desired, a label should be assigned to the button by passing `aria-label` to the `htmlAttributes` property on the button.

### Tips

While this is not a complete list, here are some guidelines to follow when using toasts.

* Do not require user interaction to dismiss toasts. For example, having a "Dismiss" button in the toast is fine, but the toast should also automatically dismiss on its own after a timeout period. If you need user interaction for a notification, consider using an [alert](./alert) instead.

* For toasts with long messages, consider adjusting the `duration` property to allow users enough time to read the content of the toast.

* If adding buttons to a toast, always provide alternative ways of completing the actions associated with each button. This ensures that even if the toast dismisses before a user can read it, they can still complete the actions shown in the toast.

* Avoid showing a toast with buttons from inside another overlay such as a [modal](./modal). Modals and other overlays implement [focus trapping](./modal#focus-trapping) that will prevent screen readers from moving focus to the toast to complete the actions. This may be confusing for users since the toast will still be announced by screen readers. This is true even if alternative ways of completing the actions associated with each button are implemented. Consider creating a [live region](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/ARIA_Live_Regions) within the focus-trapped modal instead of using a toast.

Toggles are switches that change the state of a single option. They can be switched on or off by pressing or swiping them. Toggles can also be checked programmatically by setting the `checked` property.

## Basic Usage

import Basic from '@site/static/usage/v8/toggle/basic/index.md';

<Basic />


## On / Off Labels

Toggles can enable on/off labels by setting the `enableOnOffLabels` property. This is important for accessibility as it makes it easier to differentiate between a checked and unchecked toggle.

import OnOff from '@site/static/usage/v8/toggle/on-off/index.md';

<OnOff />


## Toggles in a List

Toggles can also be used in a list view by using the [Item](./item) and [List](./list) components.

import List from '@site/static/usage/v8/toggle/list/index.md';

## Label Placement

Developers can use the `labelPlacement` property to control how the label is placed relative to the control.

import LabelPlacement from '@site/static/usage/v8/toggle/label-placement/index.md';

<LabelPlacement />

## Alignment

Developers can use the `alignment` property to control how the label and control are aligned on the cross axis. This property mirrors the flexbox `align-items` property.

:::note
Stacked toggles can be aligned using the `alignment` property. This can be useful when the label and control need to be centered horizontally.
:::

import Alignment from '@site/static/usage/v8/toggle/alignment/index.md';

<Alignment />

## Justification

Developers can use the `justify` property to control how the label and control are packed on a line.

import Justify from '@site/static/usage/v8/toggle/justify/index.md';

<Justify />

## Helper & Error Text

Helper and error text can be used inside of a toggle with the `helperText` and `errorText` property. The error text will not be displayed unless the `ion-invalid` and `ion-touched` classes are added to the `ion-toggle`. This ensures errors are not shown before the user has a chance to enter data.

In Angular, this is done automatically through form validation. In JavaScript, React and Vue, the class needs to be manually added based on your own validation.

Toolbars are generally positioned above or below content and provide content and actions for the current screen. When placed within the [content](./content), toolbars will scroll with the content.

Toolbars can contain several different components including titles, buttons, icons, back buttons, menu buttons, searchbars, segments, progress bars, and more.

It is recommended to put a toolbar inside of a [header](./header) or [footer](./footer) for proper positioning. When a toolbar is placed in a header it will appear fixed at the top of the content. When it is placed in a footer it will appear fixed at the bottom. Fullscreen content will scroll behind a toolbar in a header or footer. A [title](./title) component can be used to display text inside of the toolbar.

import Basic from '@site/static/usage/v8/toolbar/basic/index.md';

<Basic />


## Buttons in Toolbars

Buttons placed in a toolbar should be placed inside of the [buttons](./buttons) component. The buttons component can be positioned inside of the toolbar using a named [slot](#slots). The `"primary"` and `"secondary"` slots behave differently in `ios` and `md` mode.

The buttons component can wrap a standard [button](./button), [back button](./back-button), [menu button](./menu-button), or several of any of them. A button in a toolbar is styled to be clear by default, but this can be changed using the [`fill`](./button#fill) property on the button. The properties included on back button and menu button in this example are for display purposes; see their respective documentation for proper usage.

import Buttons from '@site/static/usage/v8/toolbar/buttons/index.md';

<Buttons />


## Searchbars in Toolbars

A [searchbar](./searchbar) can be placed inside of a toolbar to search through the content. It should be the only child component of the toolbar, and will take up the full width and height.

import Searchbars from '@site/static/usage/v8/toolbar/searchbars/index.md';

<Searchbars />


## Segments in Toolbars

[Segments](./segment) are generally used in toolbars to toggle between two different content views on the same page. They can be placed in a toolbar with other components, such as buttons, but should not be placed alongside a title.

import Segments from '@site/static/usage/v8/toolbar/segments/index.md';

<Segments />


## Progress Bars in Toolbars

A [progress bar](./progress-bar) is used as a loading indicator to show an ongoing process in an app. Progress bars can be placed with any other components inside of a toolbar as they will align with the bottom of the toolbar.

import ProgressBars from '@site/static/usage/v8/toolbar/progress-bars/index.md';

<ProgressBars />

### CSS Custom Properties

import CSSProps from '@site/static/usage/v8/toolbar/theming/css-properties/index.md';

<CSSProps />


## Borders

In `md` mode, the `<ion-header>` will receive a box-shadow on the bottom, and the `<ion-footer>` will receive a box-shadow on the top.  In `ios` mode, the `<ion-header>` will receive a border on the bottom, and the `<ion-footer>` will receive a border on the top.

  <title>Ionic CLI Framework: Command-Line Interface to Develop Apps</title>
  <meta
    name="description"
    content="The Ionic command-line interface (CLI) is the go-to tool for developing Ionic apps. Install our framework globally with npm."
  />
</head>

The Ionic command-line interface ([CLI](/docs/reference/glossary#cli)) is the go-to tool for developing Ionic apps.

## Installation

The Ionic CLI can be installed globally with npm:

```shell
npm install -g @ionic/cli
```

## Help

The Ionic CLI ships with command documentation that is accessible with the `--help` flag.

```shell
$ ionic --help
$ ionic <command> --help
$ ionic <command> <subcommand> --help
```

:::note
Be sure to run `ionic <command> --help` in your project directory.

For some commands, such as `ionic serve`, the help documentation is contextual to the type of your project, e.g. React vs Angular.
:::

<!-- TODO: image? -->

## Architecture

The Ionic CLI is built with [TypeScript](/docs/reference/glossary#typescript) and [Node.js](/docs/reference/glossary#node). It supports Node 10.3+, but the latest Node LTS is always recommended. Follow development on the open source <a href="https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-cli" target="_blank">GitHub repository</a>.

## Troubleshooting

To troubleshoot issues with the Ionic CLI, the following may be useful:

- Make sure the latest version of the Ionic CLI is installed. Get the installed Ionic CLI version by running `ionic --version`. The Ionic CLI version is not related to the Ionic Framework version.
- Make sure the latest Node LTS is installed. See [Node & npm](/docs/intro/environment#node-npm) environment setup.
- The `--verbose` flag prints debugging messages, which may narrow down the issue.
- Connection issues may be due to improperly configured proxy settings. See [Using a Proxy](/docs/cli/using-a-proxy) to configure request proxying.
- The global Ionic CLI configuration directory is `~/.ionic` on all platforms. It can safely be deleted and the Ionic CLI will repopulate it, but all configuration (including user sessions) will be lost. Configure this directory with [CLI environment variables](/docs/cli/configuration#environment-variables).

  <title>Capacitor Configuration | Maintain a Global Configuration File</title>
  <meta
    name="description"
    content="Set and print configuration values from project config files and the global CLI config file with Ionic CLI. Read to learn more about Capacitor configuration."
  />
</head>

## Files

Configuration values are stored in JSON files. The Ionic CLI maintains a global configuration file, usually located at `~/.ionic/config.json`, and project configuration files, usually at the project's root directory as `ionic.config.json`.

The CLI provides commands for setting and printing config values from project config files and the global CLI config file. See `ionic config --help` or see the documentation for usage of [`ionic config get`](commands/config-get.md) and [`ionic config set`](commands/config-set.md).

### Project Configuration File

Each Ionic project has a project configuration file, usually at the project's root directory. The following is an annotated `ionic.config.json` file.

```json
{
  // The human-readable name of the app.
  "name": "My App",

  // The project type of the app. The CLI uses this value to determine which
  // commands and command options are available, what to output for help
  // documentation, and what to use for web asset builds and the dev server.
  "type": "angular",

  // The App ID for Appflow.
  "id": "abc123",

  // Configuration object for integrations such as Cordova and Capacitor.
  "integrations": {
    "cordova": {
      ...
    }
  },

  // Hook configuration--see the Hooks section below for details.
  "hooks": {
    ...
  }
}
```

## Environment Variables

The CLI will look for the following environment variables:

- `IONIC_CONFIG_DIRECTORY`: The directory of the global CLI config. Defaults to `~/.ionic`.
- `IONIC_HTTP_PROXY`: Set a URL for proxying all CLI requests through. See [Using a Proxy](using-a-proxy.md).
- `IONIC_TOKEN`: Automatically authenticates with [Appflow](https://ionic.io/appflow).

## Flags

CLI flags are global options that alter the behavior of a CLI command.

- `--help`: Instead of running the command, view its help page.
- `--verbose`: Show all log messages for debugging purposes.
- `--quiet`: Only show `WARN` and `ERROR` log messages.
- `--no-interactive`: Turn off interactive prompts and fancy outputs. If CI or a non-TTY terminal is detected, the CLI is automatically non-interactive.
- `--confirm`: Turn on auto-confirmation of confirmation prompts. Careful: the CLI prompts before doing something potentially harmful. Auto-confirming may have unintended results.

## Hooks

The CLI can run scripts during certain events, such as before and after builds. To hook into the CLI, the following [npm scripts](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts) can be used in `package.json`:

- `ionic:serve:before`: executed before the dev server starts
- `ionic:serve:after`: executed after the dev server is terminated
- `ionic:build:before`: executed before a web asset build begins
- `ionic:build:after`: executed after a web asset build finishes
- `ionic:capacitor:run:before`: executed during `ionic capacitor run` before capacitor open is executed
- `ionic:capacitor:build:before`: executed during `ionic capacitor build` before capacitor open is executed
- `ionic:capacitor:sync:after`: executed during `ionic capacitor sync` after a sync

When using a shell script for any of the hooks, hook context is defined in environment variables prefixed with `IONIC_CLI_HOOK_CTX_`.

The following example shows the environment variables that are set for the `ionic:capacitor:build` hook.

```shell
IONIC_CLI_HOOK_CTX_NAME=capacitor:build:before
IONIC_CLI_HOOK_CTX_BUILD_CORDOVA_ASSETS=true
IONIC_CLI_HOOK_CTX_BUILD_ENGINE=browser
IONIC_CLI_HOOK_CTX_BUILD_PROJECT=app
IONIC_CLI_HOOK_CTX_BUILD_TYPE=angular
IONIC_CLI_HOOK_CTX_BUILD_VERBOSE=false
IONIC_CLI_HOOK_CTX_CAPACITOR_APP_ID=io.ionic.starter
IONIC_CLI_HOOK_CTX_CAPACITOR_APP_NAME=ionic-starter-app
IONIC_CLI_HOOK_CTX_CAPACITOR_VERBOSE=false
```

Hooks can also be defined in `ionic.config.json`. Define a `hooks` object within the project, where each key is the name of the hook (without the `ionic:` prefix), and the value is a path to a JavaScript file or an array of paths.

In the following example, the file is imported and run during the `ionic:build:before` hook.

```json
"hooks": {
  "build:before": "./scripts/build-before.js"
},
```

JavaScript hook files should export a single function, which is passed a single argument (`ctx`) whenever the hook executes.

The argument is the context given to the hook file, which differs from hook to hook and with different invocations.

`./scripts/build-before.js`:

```javascript
module.exports = function (ctx) {
  console.log(ctx);
};
```

## Multi-app Projects

<small>
  <em>Available in CLI 6.2.0+</em>
</small>

The Ionic CLI supports a multi-app configuration setup, which involves multiple Ionic apps and shared code within a single repository, or [monorepo](../reference/glossary.md#monorepo).

:::note
These docs give an overview of the multi-app feature of the Ionic CLI, but don't really go into details for each framework.

If you're using Angular, please see [this article](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-cli/wiki/Angular-Monorepo) for examples.
:::

### Setup Steps

1. Create a directory and initialize a monorepo (see [Project Structure](#project-structure) for full details).
1. Initialize the monorepo as an Ionic multi-app project. This will create a multi-app `ionic.config.json` file. See [Config File](#config-file) for full details.

   ```shell
   $ ionic init --multi-app
   ```

1. Use `ionic start` to create Ionic apps or `ionic init` to initialize existing apps (see [Adding an App](#adding-an-app) for full details).

### Project Structure

In a multi-app project, project structure is flexible. The only requirement is a multi-app `ionic.config.json` file at the root of the repository.

Below is an example setup, where apps in the `apps/` directory are separated from the shared code in the `lib/` directory. Notice the root `ionic.config.json` file and the monorepo's `package.json` file.

```bash
apps/
├── myApp/
└── myOtherApp/
lib/
ionic.config.json
package.json
```

### Config File

In a multi-app project, apps share a single `ionic.config.json` file at the root of the repository instead of each app having their own. The multi-app config file contains the configuration for each app by nesting configuration objects in a `projects` object. A default app can be specified using `defaultProject`.

Below is an example file, which corresponds to the file structure above.

```json
{
  "defaultProject": "myApp",
  "projects": {
    "myApp": {
      "name": "My App",
      "integrations": {},
      "type": "angular",
      "root": "apps/myApp"
    },
    "myOtherApp": {
      "name": "My Other App",
      "integrations": {},
      "type": "angular",
      "root": "apps/myOtherApp"
    }
  }
}
```

When a multi-app project is detected, the Ionic CLI will operate under the context of an app configured in the root `ionic.config.json`. Project selection criteria is as follows:

1. If the global CLI option `--project` is specified, the project is looked up by key in the `projects` object. For example, `--project=myApp` will select the `myApp` project.
1. If the CLI detects it is being run within a project path, configured with the `root` key, it will select the matched project. For example, using the CLI within the `apps/myOtherApp/src` directory will select the `myOtherApp` project.
1. If a `defaultProject` is specified in `ionic.config.json`, it will select the specified project when the above criteria is not met.

### Adding an App

Apps can be registered in a multi-app project either by using `ionic start` to create new apps or `ionic init` to initialize existing apps.

#### Using `ionic start`

If a multi-app project is detected during `ionic start`, the CLI will add the app configuration to the root `ionic.config.json` file instead of creating a project-specific one.

Dependency installation can be skipped using `--no-deps` if dependencies are hoisted to the root of the monorepo.

```shell
$ cd apps/
$ ionic start "My New App" --no-deps
```

#### Using `ionic init`

If an app was created in a way other than `ionic start`, for example by using a prebuilt template, use `ionic init` to register the existing app with the multi-app project.

:::note
Make sure the app doesn't have an existing `ionic.config.json`.
:::

```shell
$ cd apps/existing-app/
$ ionic init
```

## Advanced Configuration

### Overriding the Build

Normally, the CLI runs a hard-coded set of commands based on the project type. For example, the standard web asset build for Angular projects is `ng run app:build`. The web asset build can be overridden and `ionic build` can continue to be used by utilizing the `ionic:build` [npm script](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts). Similarly, the dev server can be overridden by using the `ionic:serve` npm script.

Pay close attention to the flags supplied to the script by the Ionic CLI. Irregularities may occur if options are not respected, especially for livereload on devices.

### Command Options

Command options can be expressed with environment variables. They are normally set with `--opt=value` syntax. The naming of these environment variables follows a pattern: start with `IONIC_CMDOPTS_`, add the command name (replacing any spaces with underscores), add the option name (replacing any hyphens with underscores), and then uppercase everything. Boolean flags (command-line options that don't take a value) can be set to `1` or `0`. Strip the `--no-` prefix in boolean flags, if it exists (`--no-open` in ionic serve can be expressed with `IONIC_CMDOPTS_SERVE_OPEN=0`, for example).

For example, the command options in `ionic cordova run ios -lc --livereload-port=1234 --host=0.0.0.0` can also be expressed with this series of environment variables:

```shell
$ export IONIC_CMDOPTS_CORDOVA_RUN_LIVERELOAD=1
$ export IONIC_CMDOPTS_CORDOVA_RUN_CONSOLELOGS=1
$ export IONIC_CMDOPTS_CORDOVA_RUN_LIVERELOAD_PORT=1234
$ export IONIC_CMDOPTS_CORDOVA_RUN_HOST=0.0.0.0
```

If these variables are set in the environment, `ionic cordova build ios` will use new defaults for its options.

### Telemetry

The CLI sends usage data to Ionic to create a better experience. To disable this functionality, run `ionic config set -g telemetry false`.

-------- ./cli/livereload.md --------
# Live Reload

Using the Live Reload option will reload the browser or [Web View](../core-concepts/webview.md) when you change your app's code in your development environment. This is particularly useful for developing using hardware devices.

## Terms

Live Reload is a conflated term. With `ionic serve`, Live Reload just refers to reloading the browser when changes are made. Live Reload can also be used with Capacitor and Cordova to provide the same experience on virtual and hardware devices, which eliminates the need for re-deploying a native binary.

## Usage

Since Live Reload requires the Web View to load your app from a URL hosted by your computer instead of just reading files on the device, setting up live-reload for hardware devices can be tricky.

As with regular device deploys, you will need a cable to connect your device to your computer. The difference is the Ionic CLI configures the Web View to load your app from the dev server on your computer.

### Capacitor

To use Live Reload with Capacitor, make sure you're either using a virtual device or a hardware device connected to the same Wi-Fi network as your computer. Then, you'll need to specify that you want to use an external IP address for the dev server using the `--external` flag.

```shell
$ ionic capacitor run ios -l --external
$ ionic capacitor run android -l --external
```

:::note
Remember, with the `--external` option, others on your Wi-Fi network will be able to access your app.
:::

### Cordova

#### Android

For Android devices, the Ionic CLI will automatically forward the dev server port. This means you can use a `localhost` address and it will refer to your computer when loaded in the Web View, not the device.

The following all-in-one command will start a live-reload server on `localhost` and deploy the app to an Android device using Cordova:

```shell
ionic cordova run android -l
```

#### iOS

For iOS devices, port forwarding is not yet an option. This means you'll need to connect your device to the same Wi-Fi network as your computer and use an external address for the dev server.

In some cases, the Ionic CLI won't know the address with which to configure the Web View, so you may be prompted to select one. Be sure to select the address of your computer on your Wi-Fi network.

The following all-in-one command will start a live-reload server on **all addresses** and deploy the app to an iOS device using Cordova:

```shell
ionic cordova run ios -l --external
```

:::note
Remember, with the `--external` option, others on your Wi-Fi network will be able to access your app.
:::

## Tips

- With Cordova, use the `--device`, `--emulator`, and `--target` options to narrow down target devices. Use the `--list` option to list all targets. See usage in the [command docs](commands/cordova-run.md).
- You can separate the dev server process and the deploy process by using `ionic serve` and the `--livereload-url` option of `ionic cordova run` or `ionic capacitor run`.
- For Android, it is possible to configure [adb](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb) to always forward ports while the adb server is running (see `adb reverse`). With port forwarding set up, an external address would no longer be required. You can also setup the adb bridge over TCP such that subsequent deploys no longer need a USB cable.
- If you are using a development container with Angular, you may see that live reload does not work. To fix it, set `projects.app.architect.serve.configurations.development.poll` to `1` in `angular.json`.

### Using SSL

Live reload will use HTTP by default which will cause web APIs that require a secure context (like [web crypto](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Crypto_API)) to fail. To establish a secure context you can use the `--ssl` argument to use HTTPS.

For example, with an Angular application you can run the following to pass a certificate and private key and serve your app with HTTPS:

```shell
ionic capacitor run android --livereload --external --ssl -- --ssl-cert='server.crt' --ssl-key='server.key'
```

Using a self signed certificate and ensuring it is trusted by the device is a complicated topic and is covered in [this article](https://ionic.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/11384425513623).

-------- ./cli/using-a-proxy.md --------
# Using a Proxy

Proxy support is built-in to the Ionic CLI. Proxy settings can be configured via the config file or an environment variable.

To configure proxy settings via the config file, run the following with the URL of the proxy server:

```shell
ionic config set -g proxy http://proxy.example.com:8888
```

To configure proxy settings via an environment variable, use one of the following:

```shell
$ export HTTP_PROXY="http://proxy.example.com:8888" # also used by npm
$ export HTTPS_PROXY="https://proxy.example.com:8888" # also used by npm
$ export IONIC_HTTP_PROXY="http://proxy.example.com:8888"
```

### Other CLIs

Each CLI that you use must be configured separately to proxy network requests.

#### npm

```shell
npm config set proxy http://proxy.company.com:8888
```

#### git

```shell
git config --global http.proxy http://proxy.example.com:8888
```

### SSL Configuration

The Ionic CLI can be configured to use various SSL settings for HTTP requests.

```shell
$ ionic config set -g ssl.cafile /path/to/cafile # file path to your CA root certificate
$ ionic config set -g ssl.certfile /path/to/certfile # file path to a client certificate
$ ionic config set -g ssl.keyfile /path/to/keyfile # file path to a client key file
```

The `cafile`, `certfile`, and `keyfile` entries can be manually edited as arrays of strings in `~/.ionic/config.json` to include multiple files.

# Cross Platform

Ionic is built from the ground up to make development easy, no matter what platform you are building for. Ionic apps are truly cross-platform: able to run as an Android, iOS, Electron, and Progressive Web App (PWA), all from a single codebase. There are some points to keep in mind when optimizing an app to work across these platforms.

## Hardware APIs

In a native application, it's common to make API calls to communicate with the device, such as opening the camera or accessing geolocation. These API calls won’t work when called in a web environment because there’s no native bridge. There are a few ways Ionic handles this.

### Ionic Native

[Ionic Native](../native.md) has its own internal logic to detect if it is inside of a native environment. Instead of throwing a runtime error, it will print a warning if it is not a native environment and there are no Cordova plugins available. The app won’t break and it will continue to work, although without the native functionality.

### Platform Detection

In an app’s logic, whenever it is needed to make a native API call, it is recommended to always check the status of the native environment first. For example:

```tsx
this.platform.ready().then(() => {
  // 'hybrid' detects both Cordova and Capacitor
  if (this.platform.is('hybrid')) {
    // make your native API calls
  } else {
    // fallback to browser APIs
  }
});
```

This bit of code can be incredibly helpful when targeting environments where access to the native APIs is uncertain.

### Browser Fallbacks

Many native APIs that people use (for example, the File API), are not available in the browser. The APIs are always improving and catching up to native, so it is recommended to research them. Taking the first two points into consideration, it's fairly easy to create a nice experience that will adapt for the platform the app is running on.

## Responsive UI

When planning to deploy an app that may be used across a variety of devices, it is important to ensure the app works smoothly on larger screen sizes.

### Layout

Many people rarely notice the layout of an app, but it can have a massive impact on experience and usability. Consider this common UI pattern:

```html
<ion-content>
  <ion-item>
    <ion-label>Item 1</ion-label>
  </ion-item>
  <ion-item>
    <ion-label>Item 2</ion-label>
  </ion-item>
  <ion-item>
    <ion-label>Item 3</ion-label>
  </ion-item>
  <ion-item>
    <ion-label>Item 4</ion-label>
  </ion-item>
  <ion-item>
    <ion-label>Item 5</ion-label>
  </ion-item>
</ion-content>
```

This will render 5 items with a width of 100% each. This may look great on a phone, but viewing this on a larger screen is a different story. The items become stretched to fill the entire screen because of the wide screen width, leaving screen space unused.

<img src={require('@site/static/img/building/cross-platform-items.png').default} />

To improve this experience, we can wrap the items in a [Grid](../api/grid.md) component. The view can be easily rewritten into something more usable on larger screens:

```html
<ion-grid>
  <ion-row>
    <ion-col>
      <ion-item>
        <ion-label>Item 1</ion-label>
      </ion-item>
    </ion-col>
    <ion-col>
      <ion-item>
        <ion-label>Item 2</ion-label>
      </ion-item>
    </ion-col>
    <ion-col>
      <ion-item>
        <ion-label>Item 3</ion-label>
      </ion-item>
    </ion-col>
    <ion-col>
      <ion-item>
        <ion-label>Item 4</ion-label>
      </ion-item>
    </ion-col>
    <ion-col>
      <ion-item>
        <ion-label>Item 5</ion-label>
      </ion-item>
    </ion-col>
  </ion-row>
</ion-grid>
```

By wrapping the items in an `ion-grid` element, the Ionic grid system is added to our layout. Wrapping each item in a column makes the items take up equal-width inside of the grid, along the same row.

<img src={require('@site/static/img/building/cross-platform-grid.png').default} />

We can take this even further by adding the `fixed` attribute to the `<ion-grid>` element. This tells the grid to have a fixed width based on the screen size. This is perfect for larger screens when items will begin to stretch again without a width on the grid.

<img src={require('@site/static/img/building/cross-platform-grid-fixed.png').default} />

The grid can be further customized to change the sizes of columns with the addition of the `ion-col` properties.

```html
<ion-grid fixed>
  <ion-row>
    <ion-col size="12" size-sm="9" size-md="6" size-lg="4" size-xl="3">
      <ion-item>
        <ion-label>Item 1</ion-label>
      </ion-item>
    </ion-col>
    <ion-col size="12" size-sm="9" size-md="6" size-lg="4" size-xl="3">
      <ion-item>
        <ion-label>Item 2</ion-label>
      </ion-item>
    </ion-col>
    <ion-col size="12" size-sm="9" size-md="6" size-lg="4" size-xl="3">
      <ion-item>
        <ion-label>Item 3</ion-label>
      </ion-item>
    </ion-col>
    <ion-col size="12" size-sm="9" size-md="6" size-lg="4" size-xl="3">
      <ion-item>
        <ion-label>Item 4</ion-label>
      </ion-item>
    </ion-col>
    <ion-col size="12" size-sm="9" size-md="6" size-lg="4" size-xl="3">
      <ion-item>
        <ion-label>Item 5</ion-label>
      </ion-item>
    </ion-col>
  </ion-row>
</ion-grid>
```

There’s a lot going on in the example above. These are the key points:

- The `ion-col` gets its width from the `size` attribute added to it, where the value of size is the number of columns to take up out of the total available columns. The default number of available columns is 12.

- The `size` attribute can have a breakpoint added to it, `size-{breakpoint}`. This value sets the size for the specified breakpoint and above.

For more information on customizing with grid, see the [Grid](../api/grid.md) documentation.

## Storage

Most apps at some point will need to store some sort of data locally. Whether it’s storing some JSON from an XHR request, or saving an auth token, there are many different storage options available. On top of this, if the app is running in a native environment, it is possible to create a full SQLite database and store data there. All of these different storage mechanisms have their own advantages and disadvantages, but Ionic developers should not have to worry about that.

### Ionic Storage

In this case, <a href="https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-storage" target="_blank">Ionic’s Storage library</a> is a perfect candidate for the multi-environment use case. Built on top of the well tested LocalForage library, Ionic’s storage class provides an adaptable storage mechanism that will pick the best storage solution for the current run time.

Currently this means it will run through SQLite for native, IndexedDB (if available), WebSql, or Local Storage. By handling all of this, it allows writing to storage using a stable API.

```tsx
class MyClass {
  constructor(public storage: Storage) {}

  async setData(key, value) {
    const res = await this.storage.set(key, value);
    console.log(res);
  }

  async getData(key) {
    const keyVal = await this.storage.get(key);
    console.log('Key is', keyVal);
  }
}
```

There are other storage solutions out there as well, such as PouchDB, which provide a similar, adaptable storage mechanism.

  <title>App Development Core Concepts and Tools - Ionic Framework API</title>
  <meta
    name="description"
    content="For those new to Ionic app development, a high-level understanding of the core concepts and tools behind the project helps. Read to learn more about Ionic API."
  />
</head>

For those completely new to Ionic app development, it can be helpful to get a high-level understanding of the core philosophy, concepts, and tools behind the project. Before diving into complex topics, we'll cover the basics of what Ionic Framework is, and how it works.

## UI Components

Ionic Framework is a library of UI Components, which are reusable elements that serve as the building blocks for an application. Ionic Components are built with [web standards](../reference/glossary.md#web-standards) using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Though the components are pre-built, they're designed from the ground up to be highly customizable so apps can make each component their own, allowing each app to have its own look and feel. More specifically, Ionic components can be easily themed to globally change appearance across an entire app. For more information about customizing the look, please see [Theming](../theming/basics.md).

## Adaptive Styling

Adaptive Styling is a built-in feature of Ionic Framework which allows app developers to use the same code base for multiple platforms. Every Ionic component adapts its look to the platform on which the app is running on. For example, Apple devices, such as the iPhone and iPad, use Apple's own <a href="https://www.apple.com/ios" target="_blank">iOS design language</a>. Similarly, Android devices use Google's design language called <a href="https://material.io/guidelines/" target="_blank">Material Design</a>.

By making subtle design changes between the platforms, users are provided with a familiar app experience. An Ionic app downloaded from Apple's App Store will get the iOS theme, while an Ionic app downloaded from Android's Play Store will get the Material Design theme. For the apps that are viewed as a Progressive Web App (PWA) from a browser, Ionic will default to using the Material Design theme. Additionally, deciding which platform to use in certain scenarios is entirely configurable. More information about adaptive styling can be found in [Theming](../theming/basics.md).

## Navigation

Traditional web apps use a linear history, meaning that the user navigates forward to a page and can hit the back button to navigate back.
An example of this is clicking around Wikipedia where the user is going forward and backward on the browser's linear history stack.

In contrast, mobile apps often utilize parallel, "non-linear" navigation. For example, a tabbed interface can have separate navigation stacks for each tab, making sure the user never loses their place as they navigate and switch between tabs.

Ionic apps embrace this mobile navigation approach, supporting parallel navigation histories that can also be nested, all while maintaining the familiar browser-style navigation concepts web developers are familiar with.

For apps that are built with Angular and `@ionic/angular`, we recommend using the <a href="https://angular.io/guide/router" target="_blank">Angular Router</a> which comes out of the box for every new Ionic 4 Angular app.

## Native Access

An amazing feature of apps built with web technologies (such as Ionic apps!) is that it can run on virtually any platform: desktop computers, phones, tablets, cars, refrigerators, and more! The same code base for Ionic apps can work on many platforms because it is based on web standards and common APIs that are shared across these platforms.

One of the most common use cases for Ionic is to build an app which can be downloaded from both the <a href="https://www.apple.com/ios/app-store/" target="_blank">App Store</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/" target="_blank">Play Store</a>. Both iOS and Android software development kits (SDKs) provide [Web Views](webview.md) which render any Ionic app, while still allowing for <i>full</i> Native SDK access.

Projects such as <a href="https://capacitorjs.com/" target="_blank">Capacitor</a> and <a href="https://cordova.apache.org/" target="_blank">Cordova</a> are commonly used to give Ionic apps this access to Native SDKs. This means developers can quickly build out an app using common web development tools, and still have access to native features such as the device's accelerometer, camera, GPS, and more.

## Theming

At the core, Ionic Framework is built using <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS" target="_blank">CSS</a> which allows us to take advantage of the flexibility that <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_variables" target="_blank">CSS properties (variables)</a> provide. This makes it incredibly easy to design an app that looks great while following the web standard. We provide a set of colors so developers can have some great defaults, but we encourage overriding them to create designs that match a brand, company or a desired color palette. Everything from the background color of an application to the text color is fully customizable. More information on app theming can be found in [Theming](../theming/basics.md).

## Events

Many Ionic components use [CustomEvent](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CustomEvent) to inform developers of important state changes in the components. For example, an `ion-datetime` component will emit `ionChange` whenever the selected date has changed.

Developers can use standard events such as `click` as they normally would. However, many events emitted within a component's [shadow root](../reference/glossary.md#shadow) will be [retargeted](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#retarget) to the host element. This may result in multiple `click` handlers executing even if the user only clicked once. As a result, developers should rely on Ionic's events to be properly informed of state changes on Ionic components. Ionic's events are prefixed with `ion` to avoid collisions with standard events. Each component's documentation page has a list of available events that developers can listen for in their applications.

## Properties

Properties are JavaScript properties that can be set on Ionic components to configure their behavior and appearance. Properties are defined in each component's [API documentation](/docs/api) page.

### Reactive Properties

Reactive properties automatically update the component when their values change. These are the most common type of property in Ionic components.

```html
<ion-button color="primary">Primary Button</ion-button>
```

The `color` property is a reactive property that configures how the button appears. If you change the `color` value after the initial render, the button will update to reflect the new value.

### Virtual Properties

Virtual properties are designed for one-time configuration during component initialization. They do not trigger re-renders when updated.

```html
<ion-button mode="ios">iOS Style Button</ion-button> <ion-button mode="md">Material Design Button</ion-button>
```

The `mode` property is a virtual property that determines which platform styles to use for a component. It can be set at the component level or globally through the app configuration. In both cases, it's set once during initialization and doesn't change during the component's lifecycle.

For more information on Ionic modes, read the [Platform Styles documentation](/docs/theming/platform-styles).

  <meta
    name="description"
    content="What is a Web View? Web Views are a full screen and full-powered web browser. Read to learn more about Capacitor Web View on Ionic Framework apps."
  />
</head>

Web Views power web apps on native devices.

The Web View is automatically provided for apps integrated with [Capacitor](../reference/glossary.md#capacitor).

For [Cordova](../reference/glossary.md#cordova), Ionic maintains a <a href="https://github.com/ionic-team/cordova-plugin-ionic-webview" target="_blank">Web View plugin</a>. The plugin is provided by default when using the Ionic CLI.

## What is a Web View?

Ionic apps are built using [web technologies](../reference/glossary.md#web-standards) and are rendered using Web Views, which are a full screen and full-powered web browser.

Modern Web Views offer many built-in <a href="https://whatwebcando.today" target="_blank">HTML5 APIs</a> for hardware functionality such as cameras, sensors, GPS, speakers, and Bluetooth, but sometimes it may also be necessary to access platform-specific hardware APIs. In Ionic apps, hardware APIs can be accessed through a bridge layer, typically by using native plugins which expose JavaScript APIs.

![Diagram illustrating the architecture of a Web View in Ionic apps, showing the bridge between native app components and web components.](/img/building/webview-architecture.png 'Web View Architecture Diagram')

The Ionic Web View plugin is specialized for modern JavaScript apps. For both iOS and Android, app files are always hosted using the `http://` protocol with an optimized HTTP server that runs on the local device.

### CORS

Web Views enforce [CORS](../reference/glossary.md#cors), so it's important that external services properly handle cross-origin requests. See the [CORS FAQs](../troubleshooting/cors.md) for information on dealing with CORS in Ionic apps.

### File Protocol

Capacitor and Cordova apps are hosted on a local HTTP server and are served with the `http://` protocol. Some plugins, however, attempt to access device files via the `file://` protocol. To avoid difficulties between `http://` and `file://`, paths to device files must be rewritten to use the local HTTP server. For example, `file:///path/to/device/file` must be rewritten as `http://<host>:<port>/<prefix>/path/to/device/file` before being rendered in the app.

For Capacitor apps, convert file URIs like so:

```javascript
import { Capacitor } from '@capacitor/core';

Capacitor.convertFileSrc(filePath);
```

For Cordova apps, the [Ionic Web View plugin](https://github.com/ionic-team/cordova-plugin-ionic-webview) provides a utility function for converting File URIs: `window.Ionic.WebView.convertFileSrc()`. There is also a corresponding Ionic Native plugin: [`@awesome-cordova-plugins/ionic-webview`](https://danielsogl.gitbook.io/awesome-cordova-plugins/ionic-webview).

</head>

<!-- TOC goes here -->

### The web...but better

A Progressive Web App (PWA) is a web app that uses modern web capabilities to deliver an app-like experience to users.
These apps meet certain requirements (see below), are deployed to servers, accessible through URLs, and indexed by search engines.

This can work in conjunction with [Capacitor](https://capacitorjs.com) to provide a multiple deploy targets for all your users.
You can deploy your app as a PWA as well as Native app and take advantage of both channels.

Ionic allows you to ship your app to not only the app store, but also deploy to the mobile web as a PWA.

### What is required

To be considered a Progressive Web App, your app must be:

- Progressive - Work for every user, regardless of browser choice, because they are built with progressive enhancement as a core tenet.

- Responsive - Fit any form factor, desktop, mobile, tablet, or whatever is next.

- Connectivity independent - Enhanced with service workers to work offline or on low quality networks.

- App-like - Use the app-shell model to provide app-style navigation and interactions.

- Fresh - Always up-to-date thanks to the service worker update process.

- Safe - Served via HTTPS to prevent snooping and ensure content has not been tampered with.

- Discoverable - Are identifiable as “applications” thanks to W3C manifests and service worker registration scope allowing search engines to find them.

- Re-engageable - Make re-engagement easy through features like push notifications.

- Installable - Allow users to “keep” apps they find most useful on their home screen without the hassle of an app store.

- Linkable - Easily share via URL and not require complex installation.

  </a>

<!-- cspell:enable -->

There is a lot here, but it boils down to a few points for Ionic apps.

#### Offline Support

Apps should be able to work offline. Whether that be displaying a proper "offline" message or caching app data for display purpose.

#### <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Manifest" target="_blank">Web App Manifest</a>

An app manifest file should describe the resources your app will need. This includes your app's displayed name, icons, as well as splash screen. If you link to the manifest file in your index.html, browsers will detect that and load the resources for you.

#### <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API" target="_blank">Service Worker</a>

Service worker could be mentioned in Offline Support, but it really deserves its own section. Service worker provides a programmatic way to cache app resources. Be it JavaScript files or JSON data from a HTTP request. The programmatic API allows developers to decide how to handle caching and provides a much more flexible experience than other options.

  <meta

    content="Review the requirements to publish an Ionic app to the Apple iOS App Store. Learn to generate a release build and other necessary steps for deployment."
  />
</head>

## Requirements

Submitting an App to the iOS App store requires a few things:

- Xcode
- A Paid Apple Developers account
- A valid provisioning profile
- App Development and Distribution certificates

To enroll in the Apple Developer Program, follow the instructions [listed here](https://developer.apple.com/programs/).

## Generating a release build

<Tabs groupId="runtime">
<TabItem value="capacitor" label="Capacitor" default>

If the iOS platform is not already added, be sure to add it:

```shell
ionic cap add ios
```

With the platform added, run the build command with the `--prod` flag:

```shell
ionic build --prod
```

This will generate the minified code for the web portion of an app.

For this first build, and after you make any binary changes like adding a plugin, use the sync command:

```shell
npx cap sync ios
```

This will also copy the minified web code over. However, if your build is only source change then you can just copy the minified web files using:

```shell
npx cap copy ios
```

From here, the project is now managed as if it was a native Xcode app (because it is).

Open the project in `./ios/` to start Xcode:

```shell
npx cap open ios
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="cordova" label="Cordova">

If the iOS platform is not already added, be sure to add it:

```shell
ionic cordova platform add ios
```

With the platform added, run the build command with the `--prod` flag:

```shell
ionic cordova build ios --prod
```

This will generate the minified code for the web portion of an app and copy it over the iOS code base.

From here, open the `.xcworkspace` file in `./platforms/ios/` to start Xcode.

:::tip
You can also have a release build generated automatically by using the `--release` flag.
:::

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Generating Signing Certs

Generating certificates for iOS is a bit of an involved process, so be sure to check [Apple's official documentation](https://help.apple.com/xcode/mac/current/#/dev3a05256b8) on what certificates are and how to generate them.

To create the certificates and profiles needed, visit [Apple's member center](https://developer.apple.com/membercenter) and follow the links described in Apple's documentation.

There are two types of certificates that matter here, Development, and Distribution. Development Certificates are just that, meant for development time. They are meant to sign an app and deploy it to devices that the certificate has access to.

Distribution certs are meant for distributing an app to the store. When an app is signed with a Distribution cert, it can be installed on any device.

## Signing the App in Xcode

After generating the correct certificates, there are options to either have Xcode automatically manage certificates or manually manage them. It's suggested to let Xcode automatically manage certificates. This will make sure that the correct Development and Distribution certs are used, based on the build type selected.

With this option selected, select `Archive` from the `Product > Archive` menu. This will build a version of the app that is ready for distribution in the app stores. After archive has been created, Xcode Organizer is opened.

Xcode Organizer displays a list with builds of the current app. Pick the last build and click 'Upload to App Store'.
There should be a place to select the team followed by some more information on the app and an 'Upload' button to click.

If the upload is successful the app should be listed under 'Activities' on [iTunes Connect](https://itunesconnect.apple.com) or listed under 'Apps' on [App Store Connect](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/). From there, the app can be published to TestFlight, or it can be sent to Apple for approval for the App Store.

## Updating an app

As an app grows, it will need to be updated with new features and fixes.
An app can be updated by either submitting a new version to Apple, or by using a live update service like Appflow's <a href="https://ionic.io/docs/appflow/deploy/intro" target="_blank">live update feature</a>.

With <strong>Live Updates</strong>, app changes can be pushed in realtime directly to users from the Appflow dashboard, without waiting for App Store approvals.

:::note
In order for the iOS App Store to accept the updated build, the config.xml file will need to be edited to increment the version value, then rebuild the app for release following the same instructions above.

# Creating a Photo Gallery with Device Storage

Last time, we successfully added the Camera plugin to the About page of our Tabs app. Currently, the photo is replaced each time a new one is taken. What if we wanted to display multiple photos together? Let’s create a photo gallery. You can follow along with the complete code for this in [the part 2 folder](https://github.com/ionic-team/photo-gallery-tutorial-ionic3/tree/master/part2) on GitHub.

## Creating a Dedicated Photo Service

From a terminal window, navigate to your Ionic project and run:

```shell
ionic g provider PhotoProvider
```

This creates a PhotoProvider class in a dedicated providers/photo folder:

```Javascript
import { HttpClient } from '@angular/common/http';
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';

/*
  Generated class for the PhotoProvider provider.

  See https://angular.io/guide/dependency-injection for more info on providers
  and Angular DI.
*/
@Injectable()
export class PhotoProvider {

  constructor(public http: HttpClient) {
    console.log('Hello PhotoProvider Provider');
  }
}
```

Within this class, add a Photo class. The “data” property represents the base64 image data of a captured photo:

```Javascript
class Photo {
  data: any;
}
```

Then, create a Photos array to represent our photo gallery:

```Javascript
export class PhotoProvider {

  public photos: Photo[] = [];

  constructor() { }
}
```

Back in `about.ts`, import PhotoProvider:

```Javascript
import { PhotoProvider } from '../../providers/photo/photo';
```

Add it to the Constructor:

```Javascript
constructor(private camera: Camera, public photoService: PhotoProvider) {  }
```

Next, move all code pertaining to the Camera plugin to the PhotoService class. This includes the takePicture method, the Camera import, and the About page constructor. Also, remove references to HttpClient - we won’t be making any HTTP calls.

Continuing on, we need to convert currentImage variable references to the new photos array. Start by adding the captured photo data into the photos array:

```Javascript
this.camera.getPicture(options).then((imageData) => {
    // Add new photo to gallery
    this.photos.unshift({
        data: 'data:image/jpeg;base64,' + imageData
    }); }, (err) => {
    // Handle error
    console.log("Camera issue: " + err);
});
```

In `about.page.ts`, remove the currentImage variable and the reference to Camera in the constructor, leaving only PhotoService:

```Javascript
export class AboutPage {
  constructor(public navCtrl: NavController, public photoService: PhotoProvider) {  }
}
```

Next, in `about.page.html`, remove the currentImage img tag. In its place, use an ion-grid component, which provides a great way to arrange elements on a page. In this case, we’ll use it to display 2 photos per row.

```html
<ion-grid>
  <ion-row>
    <ion-col col-6 *ngFor="let photo of photoService.photos">
      <img [src]="photo.data" />
    </ion-col>
  </ion-row>
</ion-grid>
```

Here, we loop through each photo in the PhotoServices photos array, adding a new column for each. Since an ion-row consists of 12 “blocks” of space, and we’re setting the size to 6 (“col-6”), only 2 photos are displayed per row.

Last, update the Fab button to call the PhotoProvider’s `takePicture` method:

```Html
<button ion-fab (click)="photoService.takePicture()">
```

Excellent! We now have a basic photo gallery working.

## Saving photos to the device

Having a working photo gallery is pretty cool, but you’ll likely notice that when the app is closed, the photos are lost forever. That’s no good, so let’s add the Ionic Storage plugin, as easy way to store key/value pairs and JSON objects. When running in a native app context, Storage will prioritize using SQLite, one of the most stable and widely used file-based databases. When running on the web or as a Progressive Web App, Storage will attempt to use IndexedDB, WebSQL, and localstorage, in that order.

The Storage plugin works perfectly for our base64 image data. To begin, add the SQLite plugin for native:

```shell
ionic cordova plugin add cordova-sqlite-storage
```

Next, add the JavaScript library for the web:

```shell
npm install --save @ionic/storage
```

Last, import the Storage module and add it to the imports list in `app.module.ts`:

```Javascript
import { IonicStorageModule } from '@ionic/storage';

imports: [
    BrowserModule,
    IonicModule.forRoot(MyApp),
    IonicStorageModule.forRoot()
  ],
```

It’s now ready to be used in our PhotoProvider class. Import it:

```Javascript
import { Storage } from '@ionic/storage-angular';
```

Then inject it via the constructor:

```Javascript
constructor(private camera: Camera, private storage: Storage) { }
```

To add the capability to save photos, there’s only a couple steps left. Update the `takePicture()` method to save the entire photos array after each photo is taken using the storage.set method:

```Javascript
this.camera.getPicture(options).then((imageData) => {
      // Add new photo to gallery
      this.photos.unshift({
        data: 'data:image/jpeg;base64,' + imageData
      });

      // Save all photos for later viewing
      this.storage.set('photos', this.photos);
    }, (err) => {
     // Handle error
     console.log("Camera issue: " + err);
    });
```

We still need to load the saved photos when the app is first opened. This is simple enough - retrieve the “photos” key then assign its value to the photos array:

```Javascript
loadSaved() {
    this.storage.get('photos').then((photos) => {
      this.photos = photos || [];
    });
  }
```

Over in the About page, call the loadSaved method once it begins loading:

```Javascript
ngOnInit() {
    this.photoService.loadSaved();
}
```

Sweet! Photos are now saved to your device. To demonstrate that they are indeed being saved, force close DevApp, reopen it, and open the About page. Or, shake your device to have the Control Menu pop up, then tap “Exit preview.” Afterwards, reload this app to view the photos.

Finally, back up your changes to Appflow:

```shell
git add .
git commit -m “implemented photo gallery”
git push ionic master
```

Next up, we’ll look at how to apply a custom theme to an Ionic app.

-------- ./developer-resources/guides/first-app-v3/intro.md --------
# Your First Ionic App - Framework v3

The great thing about Ionic is that with one codebase, you can build for any platform using familiar web tools and languages. Follow along as we create a working Photo Gallery. Here’s the before and after:

![An Ionic app's transformation from a blank 'Tab Two' to a 'Photo Gallery' with images.](/img/guides/first-app-v3/gallery-combined.png 'Ionic App Before and After Photo Gallery')

It’s easy to get started. Reference code for this guide can be [found on GitHub](https://github.com/ionic-team/photo-gallery-tutorial-ionic3/).

## Install Node.js

If you don’t have Node.js installed already, [download the LTS version](https://nodejs.org/en/).

## Install Ionic

Run the following in the command line (you may need to prepend “sudo” on a Mac):

```shell
npm install -g @ionic/cli
```

## Create an App

Next, create an Ionic app using our “Tabs” app template:

```shell
ionic start photo-gallery tabs
```

This starter project comes complete with three pre-built pages and best practices for Ionic development. With common building blocks already in place, we can add more features easily!

<strong>“Would you like to integrate your new app with Cordova to target native iOS and Android?”</strong>

Type “y” and press Enter. Project setup may take a few moments.

<strong>“Install the free Appflow SDK and connect your app?”</strong>

Type “y” and press Enter. [Appflow](https://ionicframework.com/pro) is a powerful set of services and features built on top of the flagship Ionic Framework. This includes updating your app instantly (skipping the app store review process!), packaging apps in the cloud, and error monitoring.

<strong>Log into your Ionic Account</strong>

Sign in now to easily access awesome features like Live Deploys later in this tutorial.

<strong>What would you like to do?</strong>

Choose “Create a new app on Appflow.”

<strong>Which git host would you like to use?</strong>

Choose “Appflow.”

<strong>“How would you like to connect to Appflow?”</strong>

- Choose “Automatically setup a new SSH key pair for Appflow” if you haven’t used SSH before.
- Choose “Use an existing SSH key pair” if you’ve used SSH before.

Next, change into the app folder, then push your code to Appflow:

```shell
$ cd photo-gallery
$ git push ionic master
```

That’s it! Now for the fun part - let’s see it in action.

## Run the App

Run this command next:

```shell
ionic serve
```

And voilà! Your Ionic app is now running in a web browser. Most of your app can be built right in the browser, greatly increasing development speed.

## Photo Gallery!!!

There are three tabs: “Home”, “About”, and “Contact.” Click on the About tab. It’s a blank canvas, aka the perfect spot to add camera functionality. Let’s begin to transform the About page into a Photo Gallery. Ionic features LiveReload, so when you make changes and save them, the app is updated immediately!

![Animated GIF demonstrating the LiveReload feature in Ionic, showing real-time updates in the app after code changes.](/img/guides/first-app-v3/email-photogallery.gif 'Ionic LiveReload Feature Demonstration')

Open the photo-gallery app folder in your favorite code editor of choice, then navigate to `/src/pages/about/about.html`. We see:

```html
<ion-header>
  <ion-toolbar>
    <ion-title>About</ion-title>
  </ion-toolbar>
</ion-header>

<ion-content class="ion-padding"></ion-content>
```

`ion-header` represents the top navigation and toolbar, with “About” as the title. We put our app code into `ion-content`. In this case, it’s where we’ll add a button that opens the device’s camera and shows the image captured by the camera. But first, let’s start with something obvious: renaming the About page:

```html
<ion-title>Photo Gallery</ion-title>
```

Next, open `src/pages/tabs/tabs.html`. Change the tabTitle to “Gallery” and the tabIcon to “images”:

```html
<ion-tabs>
  <ion-tab [root]="tab1Root" tabTitle="Home" tabIcon="home"></ion-tab>
  <ion-tab [root]="tab2Root" tabTitle="Gallery" tabIcon="images"></ion-tab>
  <ion-tab [root]="tab3Root" tabTitle="Contact" tabIcon="contacts"></ion-tab>
</ion-tabs>
```

Now, back up your changes to Appflow:

```shell
$ git add .
$ git commit -m “converting about page to photo gallery”
$ git push ionic master
```

That’s just the start of all the cool things we can do with Ionic. Up next, we’ll deploy the app to iOS and Android, then continue building the photo gallery.

-------- ./developer-resources/guides/first-app-v3/ios-android-camera.md --------
# Android, iOS, and the Camera - Oh My!

Previously, we got an Ionic app up and running locally in a web browser. Now, let’s get it onto your iOS or Android device, then start building the photo gallery feature. Fortunately, Ionic provides a way to skip the frustration of dealing with native SDK installations: Ionic DevApp!

The Ionic DevApp is a free app that makes it easy to run your Ionic app directly on your iOS or Android device. Download it here, then open on your device:

<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ionic-devapp/id1233447133?ls=1&mt=8">
  <img src={require('@site/static/img/guides/first-app-v3/appstore.png').default} />
</a>
<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.ionic.devapp&hl=en">
  <img src={require('@site/static/img/guides/first-app-v3/playstore.png').default} />
</a>

Afterwards, open a terminal and navigate to your Ionic project. Execute the following:

```shell
ionic serve -c
```

In DevApp, you should now see the app appear. If it doesn't, or you have any issues throughout creating this app, [see here](https://ionicframework.com/docs/pro/devapp/).

Much better! Now we can add the camera functionality. By the way, you can find reference code for this in [the “part 1” folder](https://github.com/ionic-team/photo-gallery-tutorial-ionic3/tree/master/part1) on GitHub.

Back in `about.html`, add the following:

```html
<ion-content>
  <img />

  <ion-fab center bottom>
    <button ion-fab>
      <ion-icon name="camera"></ion-icon>
    </button>
  </ion-fab>
</ion-content>
```

Save the file and watch - a camera button appears! Tap on it and notice that it doesn’t do anything. Let’s fix that next.

## Add the Camera Dependencies via the CLI

In order to use the Camera, we need to bring in its JavaScript and native library dependencies. Back over in your Terminal window, run the following command, which adds the JavaScript library to the project, thus exposing the Camera API in TypeScript code:

```shell
npm install --save @awesome-cordova-plugins/camera
```

In `package.json`, you’ll notice a new JavaScript dependency has been added:

`"@awesome-cordova-plugins/camera": "^4.12.0"`

Next, run this command to add the native iOS and Android code, effectively allowing the Camera to work on a mobile device:

```shell
ionic cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-camera
```

In `config.xml`, a new plugin entry is created:

```xml
<plugin name="cordova-plugin-camera" spec="^4.0.3" />
```

The next step is only required for iOS users. As of iOS 10, developers must provide a reason for why the app wishes to access the device camera. Add this to the bottom of `config.xml`:

```xml
<!-- Required for iOS 10: Camera permission prompt -->
<edit-config file="*-Info.plist" mode="merge" target="NSCameraUsageDescription">
    <string>Used to take pictures</string>
</edit-config>
```

## Add Camera plugin to Angular App Module

There’s one more step we need to do since this is an Angular project: register the Camera in the App Module (`src/app/app.module.ts`). First, import the Camera module:

```Javascript
import { Camera } from '@awesome-cordova-plugins/camera';
```

Then, add it as a Provider:

```Javascript
providers: [
    StatusBar,
    SplashScreen,
    Camera,
    {provide: ErrorHandler, useClass: IonicErrorHandler}
  ],
```

It can now be used on any of our App pages.

## Add the Camera to the About page

Our camera button doesn’t do anything yet. Over in `about.html`, add a click handler to the button:

```html
<button ion-fab (click)="takePicture()"></button>
```

Then, update the image placeholder. The following binds the “currentImage” variable (which we’ll work on next) to the image to display to the user.

```html
<img [src]="currentImage" *ngIf="currentImage" />
```

Open `about.ts` next and import the Camera library:

```Javascript
import { Camera, CameraOptions } from '@awesome-cordova-plugins/camera';
```

Next, define the “currentImage” variable and inject the Camera into this class via the constructor:

```Javascript
export class AboutPage {
  currentImage: any;

  constructor(public navCtrl: NavController, private camera: Camera) {
}
```

Finally, add the “takePicture” method, already wired up to execute once the camera button has been tapped:

```Javascript
takePicture() {
    const options: CameraOptions = {
      quality: 100,
      destinationType: this.camera.DestinationType.DATA_URL,
      encodingType: this.camera.EncodingType.JPEG,
      mediaType: this.camera.MediaType.PICTURE
    }

    this.camera.getPicture(options).then((imageData) => {
      this.currentImage = 'data:image/jpeg;base64,' + imageData;
    }, (err) => {
     // Handle error
     console.log("Camera issue:" + err);
    });
  }
```

Take notice: there’s no mention of iOS or Android! This is the awesome power of plugins: you use one API (`camera.getPicture()` in this case) and the plugin takes care of the platform differences for you. Write once, run everywhere `:)`

Save this file then tap the Camera button in DevApp. Voila! The camera should open on your device. Once a photo has been taken, it displays on the Photo Gallery page.

Finally, back up your changes to Appflow:

```shell
git add .
git commit -m “added camera functionality”
git push ionic master
```

Next, we’ll look at how to transform the app into a photo gallery, as well as how to save the photos to your device!

-------- ./developer-resources/guides/first-app-v3/realtime-updates-ionic-deploy.md --------
# Realtime App Updates with Appflow Live Updates

As you’ve seen so far, building web and mobile apps is quick and easy with the Ionic Framework. However, nothing disrupts rapid iteration faster than App Store delays. Fortunately, with Appflow’s Deploy feature, you can send live code changes directly to your users. Paired with seamless background updates, they are always upgraded to the latest version.

Setting it up is quick and easy. For reference, continue to refer to [the part 3 folder](https://github.com/ionic-team/photo-gallery-tutorial-ionic3/tree/master/part3) on GitHub. First, install the Appflow JavaScript library:

```shell
npm install @ionic/pro@latest --save
```

Then, add the Appflow plugin. Here’s the command to install it:

```shell
$ ionic cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-ionic@latest --save
--variable APP_ID=YOUR_APP_ID --variable CHANNEL_NAME=YOUR_CHANNEL_NAME
```

There are two unique values to provide: your app id and channel name. Sign into Appflow, then find the App Id on your app’s dashboard:

![The location of the App ID in the Appflow dashboard.](/img/guides/first-app-v3/app-id-location.png 'Appflow App ID Location')

And we’ll just use “Master” as the channel name. Putting this together looks like:

```shell
$ ionic cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-ionic@latest --save
--variable APP_ID=381533B9 --variable CHANNEL_NAME=Master
```

After this plugin has been added, you’ll notice that `config.xml` and `package.json` have been updated with your app’s details:

```xml
<plugin name="cordova-plugin-ionic" spec="^5.0.6">
    <variable name="APP_ID" value="381533B9" />
    <variable name="CHANNEL_NAME" value="Master" />
    <variable name="WARN_DEBUG" value="true" />
    <variable name="UPDATE_API" value="https://api.ionicjs.com" />
    <variable name="UPDATE_METHOD" value="background" />
    <variable name="MAX_STORE" value="2" />
    <variable name="MIN_BACKGROUND_DURATION" value="30" />
</plugin>
```

Next, modify `src/app/app.module.ts` to include the initialization of Appflow on app startup:

```javascript
import { Pro } from '@ionic/pro';

Pro.init('YOUR_APP_ID', {
  appVersion: 'APP_VERSION',
});
```

As an example, this would look like:

```javascript
Pro.init('381533B9', {
  appVersion: '0.0.1',
});
```

Next, push the code up to Appflow:

```shell
git add .
git commit -m “adding Appflow”
git push ionic master
```

Next, create a local, native build of the app.

## Android Builds

Follow the [Android Setup instructions](../../../developing/android.md), which includes installing Java 8 and Android Studio on your machine. Then, in your Terminal run:

```shell
ionic cordova build android --prod
```

This will generate a unsigned debug build (meaning the app can run on any Android device).

## iOS Builds

iOS is [a bit trickier to set up](../../../developing/ios.md) than Android and requires a Mac computer. Ensure XCode is updated to the latest version and set up a development team. Then, in your Terminal, run:

```shell
ionic cordova build ios --prod
```

Then, continue to [follow the instructions here](../../../deployment/app-store.md) regarding signing certificates, etc. With a native version of your app built, let’s copy it to your device of choice.

## Add the Native App to Your Local Device

Now comes the fun part: testing out the native app on your device! For iOS, the easiest way (that works for both PC and Mac) involves using iTunes. Connect your iOS device, locate your IPA file, then drag and drop the IPA file from the file system onto your device in iTunes. The app will install immediately and be ready for use:

<div class="wistia_responsive_padding" style={{ padding: '62.5% 0 0 0', position: 'relative' }}>
  <div
    class="wistia_responsive_wrapper"
    style={{ height: '100%', left: 0, position: 'absolute', top: 0, width: '100%' }}
  >
    <iframe
      src="https://fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/s5v4fujv7w?videoFoam=true"
      title="Wistia video player"
      allowtransparency="true"
      frameBorder="0"
      scrolling="no"
      class="wistia_embed"
      name="wistia_embed"
      allowFullScreen
      mozallowfullscreen
      webkitallowfullscreen
      oallowfullscreen
      msallowfullscreen
      width="100%"
      height="100%"
    ></iframe>
  </div>
</div>
<script src="https://fast.wistia.net/assets/external/E-v1.js" async></script>

For Android testing, the easiest way across all OS platforms is to use [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/), Google’s official Android IDE. After downloading it, connect your Android device to your computer. On the Studio startup screen, select “Profile or debug APK”, then select the recently built APK file.

In the upper right hand corner, click the Play button. Select your connected device, then click OK:

<div class="wistia_responsive_padding" style={{ padding: '62.5% 0 0 0', position: 'relative' }}>
  <div
    class="wistia_responsive_wrapper"
    style={{ height: '100%', left: 0, position: 'absolute', top: 0, width: '100%' }}
  >
    <iframe
      src="https://fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/b2ys5v4sno?videoFoam=true"
      title="Wistia video player"
      allowtransparency="true"
      frameBorder="0"
      scrolling="no"
      class="wistia_embed"
      name="wistia_embed"
      allowFullScreen
      mozallowfullscreen
      webkitallowfullscreen
      oallowfullscreen
      msallowfullscreen
      width="100%"
      height="100%"
    ></iframe>
  </div>
</div>
<script src="https://fast.wistia.net/assets/external/E-v1.js" async></script>

## Deploying Changes

With Appflow Deploy, any JavaScript, HTML, or CSS changes can be pushed automatically to app users. Open the Photo Gallery app in your favorite code editor, then update the title of the Gallery page:

```html
<ion-header>
  <ion-toolbar>
    <ion-title>Photo Viewer</ion-title>
  </ion-toolbar>
</ion-header>
```

Next, push the code up to Appflow:

```shell
$ git add .
$ git commit -m “change name to Photo Viewer”
$ git push ionic master
```

Log into the [Appflow dashboard](https://dashboard.ionicframework.com) and navigate to Deploy -> Builds. You’ll see this newest commit begin to build immediately. Since we assigned the Appflow plugin to the Master branch (the one we always Git Push to), the Channel label will also point to this commit, effectively auto-deploying this change to all app users:

![The Deploy Builds section in the Appflow dashboard.](/img/guides/first-app-v3/deploy-channel.png 'Appflow Deploy Builds')

A Channel points to a specific JavaScript Build or Snapshot of your app that will be shared with devices listening to that channel for updates. You can change which Build a Channel points to whenever you’d like.

Each time a user launches our Photo Gallery app, it will poll for updates from Appflow. If new code is available, the update is downloaded in the background. There are [a handful of ways](https://ionic.io/docs/appflow/deploy/api#update_method) to control how updates are performed, but by default they will be applied the next time the user closes then opens the app.

When the latest Build has been successful, close your local copy of Photo Gallery app or put it in the background for 30 seconds (the [MIN_BACKGROUND_DURATION default](https://ionic.io/docs/appflow/deploy/api#min_background_duration)), then reopen it. The title of the Photo Gallery page should change from “Photo Gallery” to “Photo Viewer.”

What if you deploy a change, then realize that there is a bug? Or perhaps you’re just not happy with the name “Photo Viewer?” No problem: Appflow Deploy makes it easy to roll back changes as well!

On the Deploy Builds page, click the “Assign to Channel” button on the previous commit, then click “Deploy.” App users will be reverted to the previous version, and our “Photo Gallery” name has been restored.

![The Deploy Builds section in Appflow with a commit labeled 'set name to Photo Gallery' being assigned to the master channel for rollback.](/img/guides/first-app-v3/deploy-revertChange.png 'Appflow Deploy Revert Change')

This was just a taste of what you can do with Appflow Live Updates! You can also set up multiple deployment channels to send targeted updates to specific groups of users. Use it to run A/B tests, or target the distribution of updates by audience, geography, or test group.

## Stuck on creating local native builds?

Building native app binaries for Android and iOS can be painful. The tooling isn’t great, new OS versions often result in challenging upgrades, and creating consistent builds across your dev team can be frustrating. Fortunately, Appflow’s Package feature makes this easy: simply upload your iOS certificate and Android keystore files, then we take care of the rest!

[Start packaging your app in the cloud](https://dashboard.ionicframework.com/settings/billing) along with 10,000 Ionic Deploys per month.

# Make It Your Own! Ionic Theming

Previously, we converted our single use Camera app into an epic photo gallery. Now, let’s explore how to make the photo gallery our own with Ionic theming. The visual design of the app is incredibly important - fortunately, Ionic provides a lot for us out-of-the-box. You can find the code for this in [the “part 3” folder](https://github.com/ionic-team/photo-gallery-tutorial-ionic3/tree/master/part3) on GitHub.

Ionic has five default colors, defined as Sass variables, that can be used to change the color of its UI components:

![Ionic's default Sass color variables for theming: 'primary", secondary, danger, light, and dark.](/img/guides/first-app-v3/v3-theming.png 'Default Ionic Sass Variables')

You can customize each color further by supplying a base and contract property. Base acts as the background color and contrast acts as the text color for most components. This provides much more flexible control over your styles:

![Code snippet showing customized Ionic Sass variables with additional twitter color base and contrast properties.](/img/guides/first-app-v3/v3-themeColors.png 'Customized Ionic Sass Variables')

You can find these colors defined in `src/theme/variables.scss`.

By changing these variables here and there, you can easily update the entire theme of the application! Try changing a few of them and watch the app update in DevApp. For example, change the default blue color for Primary to purple:

```Css
$colors: (
  primary:    #7044ff,
)
```

But wait, there’s more! Ionic automatically provides platform specific styles based on the device the application is running on, giving that native look and feel your users are used to:

![Comparing the native look of an Ionic app on iOS and Android platforms.](/img/guides/first-app-v3/ion-lab-comparison.png 'Ionic Platform Specific Styles Comparison')

In our app, this is clearly visible in how the header and the icons are styled.

If you want consistency, you can tell Ionic to use the same mode regardless of platform. For example, to apply Material Design (Android’s platform style), set it globally in the App Module class. Open `src/app/app.module.ts`, then set the `mode` property:

```Javascript
imports: [
    BrowserModule,
    IonicModule.forRoot(MyApp, {
      mode: "md"
    }, null),
    IonicStorageModule.forRoot()
  ],
```

Now, the iOS version of our app has a Material Design skin!

![An Ionic app with Material Design styling applied on an iOS device.](/img/guides/first-app-v3/ion-lab-md-styling.png 'Ionic Material Design Styling on iOS')

Creating gorgeous-looking Ionic apps is easy with Sass variables and platform-specific styling. You now have everything you need to get started with Ionic. Go forth and build great apps!

If you're interested in taking your Ionic apps to the next level, continue on with our exploration of Appflow next.

# Track Bugs in Realtime with Ionic Monitoring

Bugs happen, and can be hard to track down - especially with hundreds of possible combinations of mobile devices and operating systems. Appflow Monitoring allows you to track errors in your app on users’ phones and it sends them directly to you instantly, even if your code is minified!

Reducing customer frustration by fixing major issues quickly in your production apps are a substantial part of providing a high quality app experience. Combined with Appflow Deploy, new updates can be rolled out quickly to address problems in real-time.

To begin, let’s add a global error handler that will catch and report all unhandled exceptions that occur in the app. Open `src/app/app.module.ts`, then add two import statements:

```javascript
import { ErrorHandler, Injectable, Injector } from '@angular/core';
import { IonicErrorHandler } from 'ionic-angular';
```

Next, create an error handler class calls the Monitoring service’s API whenever any errors have been encountered:

```javascript
@Injectable()
export class MyErrorHandler implements ErrorHandler {
  ionicErrorHandler: IonicErrorHandler;

  constructor(injector: Injector) {
    try {
      this.ionicErrorHandler = injector.get(IonicErrorHandler);
    } catch (e) {
      // Unable to get the IonicErrorHandler provider, ensure
      // IonicErrorHandler has been added to the providers list below
    }
  }

  handleError(err: any): void {
    Pro.monitoring.handleNewError(err);

    this.ionicErrorHandler && this.ionicErrorHandler.handleError(err);
  }
}
```

Then, within the providers array, update IonicErrorHandler to MyErrorHandler:

```javascript
{provide: ErrorHandler, useClass: MyErrorHandler},
```

It should then look like:

```javascript
providers: [
  // ...
  IonicErrorHandler,
  [{ provide: ErrorHandler, useClass: MyErrorHandler }],
];
```

Next, let’s intentionally create a bug so we can demonstrate the power of Ionic Monitoring. Open `about.html` and rename the takePicture method to something that doesn’t exist, such as “takePhoto”:

```html
<button ion-fab (click)="photoService.takePhoto()"></button>
```

With this change in place, anytime a user taps on the Camera button, an exception will be thrown and sent to Ionic’s Monitoring service.

Last, we need to need to create a Source Map for your app. This file makes it easy for Monitoring to pinpoint problems by providing stack traces that map back to the original, unminified TypeScript code.

Sync the current version of the app by running the following:

```shell
ionic monitoring syncmaps
```

With our intentional error in place, let’s try it out to see what happens. Run your app locally:

```shell
ionic serve
```

Tap on the Gallery tab, then the camera button. A runtime error should occur. In a browser, head over to the [Appflow dashboard](https://dashboard.ionicframework.com), then Monitor -> Monitoring. After a few minutes, the error should appear:

![An event showing error 'takePhoto is not a function' with status 'New'.](/img/guides/first-app-v3/monitoring-event.png 'Ionic Monitoring Event Overview')

Clicking on the event gives us lots of details surrounding what happened, such as a full stack trace. In this instance, we see that the error occurred three times on Mac OS X in the Chrome web browser.

![Detailed view of an event log displaying a TypeError stack trace and error details such as device, browser, and operating system.](/img/guides/first-app-v3/monitoring-details.png 'Detailed Ionic Monitoring Event Log')

Given the proliferation of mobile devices and operating systems these days, this is immensely powerful. Armed with these details, we can hone in on the problem and fix it quickly.

This is a TypeScript bug, meaning a fix can be released using Live Updates. Give it a try!

- Revert the method back to “takePicture.”
- Push the fix using Git. Remember, “git push ionic master.”
- Roll out the fix using Live Updates from the Ionic dashboard.

Supporting hundreds of mobile device types is so much easier with Appflow Monitoring.

# Creating a Photo Gallery with Device Storage

Last time, we successfully added the Camera plugin to the Tab2 page of our Tabs app. Currently, the photo is replaced each time a new one is taken. What if we wanted to display multiple photos together? Let’s create a photo gallery. You can follow along with the complete code for this [on GitHub](https://github.com/ionic-team/photo-gallery-tutorial-ionic4).

## Creating a Dedicated Photo Service

From a terminal window, navigate to your Ionic project and run:

```shell
ionic g service services/Photo
```

This creates a PhotoService class in a dedicated "services" folder:

```Javascript
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';

@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root'
})
export class PhotoService {
  constructor() { }
}
```

Within this file, add a Photo class. The “data” property represents the base64 image data of a captured photo:

```Javascript
class Photo {
  data: any;
}
```

Then, create a Photos array to represent our photo gallery:

```Javascript
export class PhotoService {

  public photos: Photo[] = [];

  constructor() { }
}
```

Back in `tab2.page.ts`, import PhotoService:

```Javascript
import { PhotoService } from '../services/photo.service';
```

Add it to the Constructor:

```Javascript
constructor(private camera: Camera, public photoService: PhotoService) {  }
```

Next, move all code pertaining to the Camera plugin to the PhotoService class. This includes the takePicture method, the Camera and CameraOptions imports, and the Tab2Page page constructor.

Continuing on, we need to convert currentImage variable references to the new photos array. Start by adding the captured photo data into the photos array:

```Javascript
this.camera.getPicture(options).then((imageData) => {
    // Add new photo to gallery
    this.photos.unshift({
        data: 'data:image/jpeg;base64,' + imageData
    }); }, (err) => {
    // Handle error
    console.log("Camera issue: " + err);
});
```

In `tab2.page.ts`, remove the currentImage variable and the reference to Camera in the constructor, leaving only PhotoService:

```Javascript
export class Tab2Page {
  constructor(public photoService: PhotoService) {  }
}
```

Next, in `tab2.page.html`, remove the currentImage img tag. In its place, use an ion-grid component, which provides a great way to arrange elements on a page. In this case, we’ll use it to display 2 photos per row.

```html
<ion-grid>
  <ion-row>
    <ion-col size="6" *ngFor="let photo of photoService.photos">
      <img [src]="photo.data" />
    </ion-col>
  </ion-row>
</ion-grid>
```

Here, we loop through each photo in the PhotoServices photos array, adding a new column for each. Since an ion-row consists of 12 “blocks” of space, and we’re setting the size to 6 (`size="6"`), only 2 photos are displayed per row.

Last, update the Fab button to call the PhotoService’s `takePicture` method:

```Html
<ion-fab-button (click)="photoService.takePicture()">
  <ion-icon name="camera"></ion-icon>
</ion-fab-button>
```

Excellent! We now have a basic photo gallery working.

## Saving photos to the device

Having a working photo gallery is pretty cool, but you’ll likely notice that when the app is closed, the photos are lost forever. That’s no good, so let’s add the [Ionic Storage plugin](https://ionicframework.com/docs/storage/), as easy way to store key/value pairs and JSON objects. When running in a native app context, Storage will prioritize using SQLite, one of the most stable and widely used file-based databases. When running on the web or as a Progressive Web App, Storage will attempt to use IndexedDB, WebSQL, and localstorage, in that order.

The Storage plugin works perfectly for our base64 image data. To begin, add the SQLite plugin for native:

```shell
ionic cordova plugin add cordova-sqlite-storage
```

Next, add the JavaScript library for the web:

```shell
npm install --save @ionic/storage
```

Last, import the Storage module and add it to the imports list in `app.module.ts`:

```Javascript
import { IonicStorageModule } from '@ionic/storage';

@NgModule({
  declarations: [AppComponent],
  entryComponents: [],
  imports: [BrowserModule, IonicModule.forRoot(), AppRoutingModule,
    IonicStorageModule.forRoot()
  ],
  providers: [
    StatusBar,
    SplashScreen,
    Camera,
    { provide: RouteReuseStrategy, useClass: IonicRouteStrategy }
  ],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent]
})
export class AppModule {}
```

It’s now ready to be used in our PhotoService class. Import it:

```Javascript
import { Storage } from '@ionic/storage-angular';
```

Then inject it via the constructor:

```Javascript
constructor(private camera: Camera, private storage: Storage) { }
```

To add the capability to save photos, there’s only a couple steps left. Update the `takePicture()` method to save the entire photos array after each photo is taken using the storage.set method:

```Javascript
this.camera.getPicture(options).then((imageData) => {
  // Add new photo to gallery
  this.photos.unshift({
    data: 'data:image/jpeg;base64,' + imageData
  });

  // Save all photos for later viewing
  this.storage.set('photos', this.photos);
}, (err) => {
  // Handle error
  console.log("Camera issue: " + err);
});
```

We still need to load the saved photos when the app is first opened. This is simple enough - retrieve the “photos” key then assign its value to the photos array:

```Javascript
loadSaved() {
  this.storage.get('photos').then((photos) => {
    this.photos = photos || [];
  });
}
```

Over in the Tab2 page, call the loadSaved method once it begins loading:

```Javascript
ngOnInit() {
  this.photoService.loadSaved();
}
```

Sweet! Photos are now saved to your device. To demonstrate that they are indeed being saved, force close DevApp, reopen it, and open the Tab2 page. Or, shake your device to have the Control Menu pop up, then tap “Exit preview.” Afterwards, reload this app to view the photos.

Next up, we’ll look at how to apply a custom theme to an Ionic app.

<div style={{ textAlign: 'right' }}>
  <DocsButton href="theming">
    Continue{' '}
    <svg viewBox="0 0 512 512">
      <path d="M294.1 256L167 129c-9.4-9.4-9.4-24.6 0-33.9s24.6-9.3 34 0L345 239c9.1 9.1 9.3 23.7.7 33.1L201.1 417c-4.7 4.7-10.9 7-17 7s-12.3-2.3-17-7c-9.4-9.4-9.4-24.6 0-33.9l127-127.1z"></path>

# Your First Ionic App: Angular

The great thing about Ionic is that with one codebase, you can build for any platform using familiar web tools and languages. Follow along as we create a working Photo Gallery. Here’s the before and after:

![An Ionic app's transformation from a blank 'Tab Two' to a 'Photo Gallery' with images.](/img/guides/first-app-v3/gallery-combined.png 'Ionic App Before and After Photo Gallery')

It’s easy to get started. Note that all code referenced in this guide can be [found on GitHub](https://github.com/ionic-team/photo-gallery-tutorial-ionic4/).

## Required Tools

Download/install these right away to ensure an optimal Ionic development experience:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) for version control.
- <strong>SSH client</strong>, such as [PuTTy](https://putty.software/), for secure login to Appflow.
- <strong>Node.js</strong> for interacting with the Ionic ecosystem. [Download the LTS version here](https://nodejs.org/en/).
- <strong>A code editor</strong> for... writing code! We are fans of [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
- <strong>Command-line terminal (CLI)</strong>: FYI <strong>Windows</strong> users, for the best Ionic experience, we
  recommend the built-in command line (cmd) or the Powershell CLI, running in Administrator mode. For <strong>
    Mac/Linux
  </strong> users, virtually any terminal will work.

## Install Ionic and Cordova

Run the following in the command line:

```shell
npm install -g @ionic/cli cordova
```

:::note
The `-g` option means _install globally_. When packages are installed globally, `EACCES` permission errors can occur.

Consider setting up npm to operate globally without elevated permissions. See [Resolving Permission Errors](../../../developing/tips.md#resolving-permission-errors) for more information.
:::

## Create an App

Next, create an Ionic Angular app using our “Tabs” app template:

```shell
ionic start photo-gallery tabs
```

This starter project comes complete with three pre-built pages and best practices for Ionic development. With common building blocks already in place, we can add more features easily!

Next, change into the app folder:

```shell
cd photo-gallery
```

That’s it! Now for the fun part - let’s see the app in action.

## Run the App

Run this command next:

```shell
ionic serve
```

And voilà! Your Ionic app is now running in a web browser. Most of your app can be built right in the browser, greatly increasing development speed.

## Photo Gallery!!!

There are three tabs. Click on the Tab2 tab. It’s a blank canvas, aka the perfect spot to add camera functionality. Let’s begin to transform this page into a Photo Gallery. Ionic features LiveReload, so when you make changes and save them, the app is updated immediately!

![Animated GIF demonstrating the LiveReload feature in Ionic, showing real-time updates in the app after code changes.](/img/guides/first-app-v3/email-photogallery.gif 'Ionic LiveReload Feature Demonstration')

Open the photo-gallery app folder in your favorite code editor of choice, then navigate to `/src/app/tab2/tab2.page.html`. We see:

```html
<ion-header>
  <ion-toolbar>
    <ion-title>Tab Two</ion-title>
  </ion-toolbar>
</ion-header>

<ion-content class="ion-padding"></ion-content>
```

`ion-header` represents the top navigation and toolbar, with "Tab 2" as the title. We put our app code into `ion-content`. In this case, it’s where we’ll add a button that opens the device’s camera and shows the image captured by the camera. But first, let’s start with something obvious: renaming the Tab Two page:

```html
<ion-title>Photo Gallery</ion-title>
```

Next, open `src/app/tabs/tabs.page.html`. Change the label to “Gallery” and the icon name to “images”:

```html
<ion-tab-button tab="tab2">
  <ion-icon name="images"></ion-icon>
  <ion-label>Gallery</ion-label>
</ion-tab-button>
```

That’s just the start of all the cool things we can do with Ionic. Up next, we’ll deploy the app to your iOS or Android device, then continue building the photo gallery.

-------- ./developer-resources/guides/first-app-v4/ios-android-camera.md --------
# Android, iOS, and the Camera - Oh My!

Previously, we got an Ionic app up and running locally in a web browser. Now, let’s get it onto your iOS or Android device, then start building the photo gallery feature.

## Add Cordova iOS and Android Platforms

Ionic leverages the open source [Cordova project](https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/guide/overview/) to provide native hardware support. We begin by adding the iOS and Android _platforms_ then will add specific _plugins_ like the Camera afterwards:

```shell
$ ionic cordova platform add ios
$ ionic cordova platform add android
```

These commands will create a `config.xml` file, which is used to define Cordova iOS and Android settings. Cordova reads this file and applies each setting as it builds each native app binary.

There are more steps to configure [iOS](../../../developing/ios.md) and [Android](../../../developing/android.md) native tooling.

Much better! Now we can add the camera functionality. By the way, you can find reference code for this [on GitHub](https://github.com/ionic-team/photo-gallery-tutorial-ionic4).

Back in `tab2.page.html`, add the following:

```html
<ion-content>
  <img />

  <ion-fab vertical="bottom" horizontal="center" slot="fixed">
    <ion-fab-button>
      <ion-icon name="camera"></ion-icon>
    </ion-fab-button>
  </ion-fab>
</ion-content>
```

Save the file and watch - a camera button appears! Tap on it and notice that it doesn’t do anything. Let’s fix that next.

## Add the Camera Dependencies via the CLI

In order to use the Camera, we need to bring in its JavaScript and native library dependencies. Back over in your Terminal window, run the following command, which adds the JavaScript library to the project, thus exposing the Camera API in TypeScript code:

```shell
npm install @awesome-cordova-plugins/camera
```

In `package.json`, you’ll notice a new JavaScript dependency has been added, with a version number similar to the following:

`"@awesome-cordova-plugins/camera": "^5.4.0"`

Next, run this command to add the native iOS and Android code, effectively allowing the Camera to work on a mobile device. For more info on how this works, read up on [Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/guide/overview/) and [Ionic Native](https://ionicframework.com/docs/native).

```shell
ionic cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-camera
```

The `config.xml` file is now updated with an entry similar to the following for the native camera code:

```xml
<plugin name="cordova-plugin-camera" spec="^4.0.3" />
```

The next step is only required for iOS users. As of iOS 10, developers must provide a reason for why the app wishes to access the device camera. Add this inside the ios platform section (<platform name="ios"></platform>) of `config.xml`:

```xml
<!-- Required for iOS 10: Camera permission prompt -->
<edit-config file="*-Info.plist" mode="merge" target="NSCameraUsageDescription">
    <string>Used to take pictures</string>
</edit-config>
```

## Add Camera plugin to Angular App Module

There’s one more step we need to do since this is an Angular project: register the Camera in the App Module (`src/app/app.module.ts`). First, import the Camera module:

```Javascript
import { Camera } from '@awesome-cordova-plugins/camera/ngx';
```

Then, add it as a Provider:

```Javascript
providers: [
    StatusBar,
    SplashScreen,
    Camera,
    {provide: ErrorHandler, useClass: IonicErrorHandler}
  ],
```

It can now be used on any of our App pages.

## Add the Camera to the Gallery page

Our camera button doesn’t do anything yet. Over in `tab2.page.html`, add a click handler to the button:

```html
<ion-fab vertical="bottom" horizontal="center" slot="fixed">
  <ion-fab-button (click)="takePicture()">
    <ion-icon name="camera"></ion-icon>
  </ion-fab-button>
</ion-fab>
```

Then, update the image placeholder. The following binds the “currentImage” variable (which we’ll work on next) to the image to display to the user.

```html
<img [src]="currentImage" *ngIf="currentImage" />
```

Open `tab2.page.ts` next and import the Camera library:

```Javascript
import { Camera, CameraOptions } from '@awesome-cordova-plugins/camera/ngx';
```

Next, define the “currentImage” variable and inject the Camera into this class via the constructor:

```Javascript
export class Tab2Page {
  currentImage: any;

  constructor(private camera: Camera) { }
}
```

Finally, add the “takePicture” method in `tab2.page.ts`. It is already wired up to execute once the camera button has been tapped:

```Javascript
export class Tab2Page {
  currentImage: any;

  constructor(private camera: Camera) { }

  takePicture() {
    const options: CameraOptions = {
      quality: 100,
      destinationType: this.camera.DestinationType.DATA_URL,
      encodingType: this.camera.EncodingType.JPEG,
      mediaType: this.camera.MediaType.PICTURE
    };

    this.camera.getPicture(options).then((imageData) => {
      this.currentImage = 'data:image/jpeg;base64,' + imageData;
    }, (err) => {
      // Handle error
      console.log("Camera issue:" + err);
    });
  }
}
```

Take notice: there’s no mention of iOS or Android! This is the awesome power of plugins: you use one API (`camera.getPicture()` in this case) and the plugin takes care of the platform differences for you. Write once, run everywhere. 😀

Save this file then tap the Camera button in DevApp. Voila! The camera should open on your device. Once a photo has been taken, it displays on the Photo Gallery page.

Next, we’ll look at how to transform the app into a photo gallery, as well as how to save the photos to your device!

-------- ./developer-resources/guides/first-app-v4/theming.md --------
# Make It Your Own! Ionic Theming

Previously, we converted our single use Camera app into an epic photo gallery. Now, let’s explore how to make the photo gallery our own with Ionic theming. The visual design of the app is incredibly important - fortunately, Ionic provides a lot for us out-of-the-box.

Ionic has nine default colors, defined as CSS variables, that can be used to change the color of its UI components:

![A chart showing Ionic's nine default colors with their hex codes.](/img/guides/first-app-v4/theming-defaults.png 'Ionic Default Color Palette')

You can customize each color further by supplying a base, contrast, shade, and tint properties. These provide flexible control over your styles:

![Table detailing the properties for customizing the primary color in Ionic, including base, contrast, shade, and tint.](/img/guides/first-app-v4/theming-properties.png 'Ionic Color Customization Properties')

You can find these colors defined in `src/theme/variables.scss`.

By changing these variables here and there, you can easily update the entire theme of the application! Try changing a few of them and watch the app update in DevApp. For example, change the default blue color for Primary to purple:

```css
/** Ionic CSS Variables **/
:root {
  /** primary **/
  --ion-color-primary: #b36bff;
  --ion-color-primary-rgb: 179, 107, 255;
  --ion-color-primary-contrast: #000000;
  --ion-color-primary-contrast-rgb: 0, 0, 0;
  --ion-color-primary-shade: #9e5ee0;
  --ion-color-primary-tint: #bb7aff;
}
```

The easiest and most powerful way to create custom color palettes for your app’s UI is Ionic's [Color Generator tool](../../../theming/color-generator.md). As you change a color’s hex values, the embedded demo app automatically reflects the new colors. When you've finished making changes, simply copy and paste the generated code directly into your Ionic project.

But wait, there’s more! Ionic automatically provides platform specific styles based on the device the application is running on, giving that native look and feel your users are used to:

![Comparing the native look of an Ionic app on iOS and Android platforms.](/img/guides/first-app-v3/ion-lab-comparison.png 'Ionic Platform Specific Styles Comparison')

In our app, this is clearly visible in how the header and the icons are styled.

If you want consistency, you can tell Ionic to use the same mode regardless of platform. For example, to apply Material Design (Android’s platform style), set it globally in the App Module class. Open `src/app/app.module.ts`, then set the `mode` property:

```Javascript
imports: [
    BrowserModule,
    IonicModule.forRoot({
      mode: "md"
    }),
    IonicStorageModule.forRoot()
  ],
```

Now, the iOS version of our app has a Material Design skin!

![An Ionic app with Material Design styling applied on an iOS device.](/img/guides/first-app-v3/ion-lab-md-styling.png 'Ionic Material Design Styling on iOS')

Creating gorgeous-looking Ionic apps is easy with CSS variables and platform-specific styling. You now have everything you need to get started with Ionic.

Go forth and build great apps!

title: Config
---

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

Ionic Config provides a way to change the properties of components globally across an app. It can set the app mode, tab button layout, animations, and more.

## Global Config

The available config keys can be found in the [`IonicConfig`](#ionicconfig) interface.

The following example disables ripple effects and default the mode to Material Design:

import GlobalExample from '@site/docs/developing/config/global/index.md';

<GlobalExample />

## Per-Component Config

Ionic Config is not reactive. Updating the config's value after the component has rendered will result in the previous value. It is recommended to use a component's properties instead of updating the config, when you require reactive values.

import PerComponentExample from '@site/docs/developing/config/per-component/index.md';

<PerComponentExample />

## Per-Platform Config

Ionic Config can also be set on a per-platform basis. For example, this allows you to disable animations if the app is being run in a browser on a potentially slower device. Developers can take advantage of the Platform utilities to accomplish this.

In the following example, we are disabling all animations in our Ionic app only if the app is running in a mobile web browser.

import PerPlatformExample from '@site/docs/developing/config/per-platform/index.md';

<PerPlatformExample />

### Fallbacks

The next example allows you to set an entirely different configuration based upon the platform, falling back to a default config if no platforms match:

import PerPlatformFallbackExample from '@site/docs/developing/config/per-platform-overrides/index.md';

<PerPlatformFallbackExample />

### Overrides

This final example allows you to accumulate a config object based upon different platform requirements.

import PerPlatformOverridesExample from '@site/docs/developing/config/per-platform-fallback/index.md';

<PerPlatformOverridesExample />

## Accessing the Mode

In some cases, you may need to access the current Ionic mode programmatically within your application logic. This can be useful for applying conditional behavior, fetching specific assets, or performing other actions based on the active styling mode.

import IonicMode from '@site/static/usage/v8/config/mode/index.md';

<IonicMode />

## Reading the Config (Angular)

Ionic Angular provides a `Config` provider for accessing the Ionic Config.

### get

  <title>Hardware Back Button for Capacitor & Cordova on Android Devices</title>
  <meta
    name="description"
    content="The hardware back button is found on most Android devices. Read to learn more about hardware back button use in Capacitor and Cordova on Ionic applications."
  />
</head>

The hardware back button is found on most Android devices. In native applications it can be used to close modals, navigate to the previous view, exit an app, and more. By default in Ionic, when the back button is pressed, the current view will be popped off the navigation stack, and the previous view will be displayed. If no previous view exists in the navigation stack, nothing will happen. This guide will show how to customize the behavior of the hardware back button.

:::note
The hardware back button refers to the physical back button on an Android device and should not be confused with either the browser back button or `ion-back-button`. The information in this guide only applies to Android devices.
:::

## Overview

Ionic Framework emits an `ionBackButton` event when a user presses the hardware back button in supported environments.

When listening for the `ionBackButton` event, you can register a handler to be fired. This handler can perform actions such as quitting the app or opening a confirmation dialog. Each handler must be assigned a priority. By default, only one handler is fired per hardware back button press. The priority value is used to determine which callback should be called. This is useful because if you have a modal open, you likely would not want the modal to close _and_ the app to navigate backwards when pressing the hardware back button. Only running one handler at a time allows the modal to close but still requires another press of the hardware back button to navigate backwards.

There are situations where you might want to have multiple handlers fired. Each handler callback passes in a function as a parameter that can be used to tell Ionic to call the next handler.

## Support

The table below shows how hardware back button support varies by environment.

| Environment | Status                                                                                                    |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Capacitor   | Supported only when the `@capacitor/app` package is installed.                                            |
| Cordova     | Supported                                                                                                 |
| Browser     | Supported only when `experimentalCloseWatcher` is `true` and the platform supports the Close Watcher API. |
| PWA         | Supported only when `experimentalCloseWatcher` is `true` and the platform supports the Close Watcher API. |

### Hardware Back Button in a Browser or a PWA

Ionic has experimental support for handling the hardware back button in a browser or a PWA by setting [`experimentalCloseWatcher: true` in the IonicConfig](./config.md). When this feature is enabled, Ionic will use the [Close Watcher API](https://github.com/WICG/close-watcher) to pass any close requests through the `ionBackButton` event. This includes pressing the hardware back button to navigate or the Escape key to dismiss a modal.

Chrome has support for Close Watcher starting in [Chrome 120](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/new-in-chrome-120).

For complete hardware back button support, we recommend using Capacitor or Cordova.

:::note
The `ionBackButton` event will not be emitted when running an app in a browser or as a PWA if Close Watcher is unsupported or `experimentalCloseWatcher` is `false`.

<TabItem value="angular">

import { Platform } from '@ionic/angular';

  });
}

```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="angular-standalone">

```tsx
import { Platform } from '@ionic/angular/standalone';

...

useBackButton(10, () => {
  console.log('Handler was called!');
});
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
````

In this example, we are registering a handler to be called when the hardware back button is pressed. We have set the priority to be 10, and we have not indicated to the framework that we want the next handler to be called. As a result, any handlers with a priority less than 10 will not be called. A handler that has a priority greater than 10 will be called first.

In the event that there are handlers with the same priority value, the handler that was registered _last_ will be called. See [Handlers with the Same Priorities](#handlers-with-the-same-priorities) for more information.

## Calling Multiple Handlers

Each hardware back button callback has a `processNextHandler` parameter. Calling this function allows you to continue calling hardware back button handlers.

  processNextHandler();
});
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
````

This example shows how to indicate to Ionic Framework that you want the next handler to be fired. All callbacks are provided with a `processNextHandler` function as a parameter. Calling this will cause the next handler, if any exists, to be fired.

## Handlers with the Same Priorities

Internally, Ionic Framework uses something similar to a priority queue to manage hardware back button handlers. The handler with the largest priority value will be called first. In the event that there are multiple handlers with the same priority value, the _last_ handler of the same priority added to this queue will be the first handler to be called.

```javascript
document.addEventListener('ionBackButton', (event) => {
  // Handler A
  event.detail.register(10, (processNextHandler) => {
    console.log('Handler A was called!');

    processNextHandler();
  });

  // Handler B
  event.detail.register(10, (processNextHandler) => {
    console.log('Handler B was called!');

    processNextHandler();
  });
});
```

In the example above, both handlers A and B have a priority of 10. Since handler B was registered last, Ionic Framework will call handler B before it calls handler A.

## Exiting the App

In some scenarios, it may be desirable to quit the app when pressing the hardware back button. This can be achieved through the use of the `ionBackButton` event combined with methods that Capacitor/Cordova provide.

This example shows the application exiting when the user presses the hardware back button and there is nothing left in the navigation stack. It is also possible to display a confirmation dialog before quitting the app.

It is recommended to check whether or not the user is on the root page prior to exiting the application. Developers can use the `canGoBack` method on `IonRouterOutlet` in Ionic Angular and `IonRouter` in Ionic React and Ionic Vue.

## Internal Framework Handlers

The table below lists all of the internal hardware back button event handlers that Ionic Framework uses. The `Propagates` column notes whether or not that particular handler tells Ionic Framework to call the next back button handler.

  <title>Keyboard Guide: Tools to Manage an On-Screen Mobile App Keyboard</title>
  <meta
    name="description"
    content="Accounting for an on-screen keyboard is a common developer roadblock. This guide introduces the tools available for managing on-screen keyboards in mobile apps."
  />
</head>

Customizing and accounting for the presence of an on-screen keyboard are two common roadblocks developers face when building mobile apps and PWAs. This guide will provide an introduction to the various tools available for managing the on-screen keyboard in your application.

## inputmode

The `inputmode` attribute allows developers to specify what type of data might be entered into an input. This will prompt the browser to show a keyboard that includes buttons relevant to what the user may enter. For example, `inputmode="email"` will display a keyboard with the `@` key as well as other optimizations for entering emails.

Since `inputmode` is a global attribute, it can be used on Ionic components such as `ion-input` and `ion-textarea` in addition to regular input elements.

Inputs that _require_ a certain data type should use the `type` attribute instead. For example, inputs that require an email should use `type="email"` rather than specifying an `inputmode.` This is because the data that will be entered is always going to be in the form of an email. On the other hand, if the input accepts an email or a username, using `inputmode=”email”` is appropriate because the data being entered is not always going to be an email address.

For a list of accepted values, see the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/inputmode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">inputmode Documentation</a>.

### Usage

import Inputmode from '@site/static/usage/v8/keyboard/inputmode/index.md';

<Inputmode />

:::note
The `inputmode` attribute is supported on devices running Chrome 66+ and iOS Safari 12.2+: https://caniuse.com/#search=inputmode
:::

## enterkeyhint

The `enterkeyhint` attribute allows developers to specify what type of action label or icon should be shown for the "Enter" key. Using `enterkeyhint` lets the user know what will happen when they tap the “Enter” key. The value that should be specified here depends on the context of what the user is doing. For example, if the user is typing into a searchbox, developers should ensure that the input has `enterkeyhint="search"`.

Since `enterkeyhint` is a global attribute, it can be used on Ionic components such as `ion-input` and `ion-textarea` in addition to regular input elements.

For a list of accepted values, see the <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/dev/interaction.html#input-modalities:-the-enterkeyhint-attribute" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">enterkeyhint Standard</a>.

### Usage

import Enterkeyhint from '@site/static/usage/v8/keyboard/enterkeyhint/index.md';

<Enterkeyhint />

:::note
The `enterkeyhint` attribute is supported on devices running Chrome 77+ and iOS Safari 13.4+.
:::

## Dark Mode

By default the keyboard theme is determined by the OS. For example, if dark mode is enabled on iOS, the keyboard in your app will appear with a dark theme even if your application does not have a dark theme in its CSS.

When running an app in a mobile web browser or as a PWA there is no way to force the keyboard to appear with a certain theme.

When running an app in Capacitor or Cordova, it is possible to force the keyboard to appear with a certain theme. For more information regarding this configuration, see the <a href="https://capacitorjs.com/docs/apis/keyboard#keyboard-configuration-ios-only-" target="_blank">Capacitor Keyboard Documentation</a>.

## Hiding the Accessory Bar

When running any kind of web based application, iOS will show an accessory bar above the keyboard. This allows users to move to the next or previous inputs as well as close the keyboard.

When running an app in a mobile web browser or as a PWA there is no way to hide the accessory bar.

When running an app in Capacitor or Cordova, it is possible to hide the accessory bar. For more information regarding this configuration, see the <a href="https://capacitorjs.com/docs/apis/keyboard#keyboard-configuration-ios-only-" target="_blank">Capacitor Keyboard Documentation</a>.

## Keyboard Lifecycle Events

Detecting the presence of an on-screen keyboard is useful for adjusting the positioning of an input that would otherwise be hidden by the keyboard. For Capacitor and Cordova apps, developers typically rely on native keyboard plugins to listen for the keyboard lifecycle events. For apps running in a mobile browser or as a PWA, developers can use the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Visual_Viewport_API" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Visual Viewport API</a> where supported. Ionic Framework wraps both of these approaches and emits `ionKeyboardDidShow` and `ionKeyboardDidHide` events on the `window`. The event payload for `ionKeyboardDidShow` contains an approximation of the keyboard height in pixels.

  <title>Managing Focus</title>
  <meta

    content="Learn how to manage focus in Ionic applications using the setFocus API instead of the autofocus attribute."
  />
</head>

## Manual Focus Management

Ionic provides a `setFocus` API on components such as [Input](../api/input), [Searchbar](../api/searchbar), and [Textarea](../api/textarea) that allows developers to manually set focus to an element. This API should be used in place of the `autofocus` attribute and called within:

- The `ionViewDidEnter` lifecycle event for routing applications when a page is entered.
- The `didPresent` lifecycle event for overlays when an overlay is presented.
- The `appload` event for vanilla JavaScript applications when the application loads.
- The result of a user gesture or interaction.

### Why not autofocus?

The `autofocus` attribute is a standard HTML attribute that allows developers to set focus to an element when a page loads. This attribute is commonly used to set focus to the first input element on a page. However, the `autofocus` attribute can cause issues in routing applications when navigating between pages. This is because the `autofocus` attribute will set focus to the element when the page loads, but will not set focus to the element when the page is revisited. Learn more about the `autofocus` attribute in the [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/autofocus).

### Platform Restrictions

There are platform restrictions you should be aware of when using the `setFocus` API, including:

1. Android requires user interaction before setting focus to an element. This can be as simple as a user tapping on the screen.
2. Interactive elements can only focused a result of a user gesture on Mobile Safari (iOS), such as calling `setFocus` as the result of a button click.

### Basic Usage

The example below demonstrates how to use the `setFocus` API to request focus on an input when the user clicks a button.

import Basic from '@site/static/usage/v8/input/set-focus/index.md';

<Basic />

### Routing

Developers can use the `ionViewDidEnter` lifecycle event to set focus to an element when a page is entered.

## Assistive Technology Focus Management

By default, Single Page Applications have no built-in way of informing screen readers that the active view has changed in a browser or webview. This means that users who rely on assistive technology do not always know if a navigation event occurred.

Developers who enable the [focusManagerPriority config](./config#ionicconfig) can delegate focus management to Ionic during page transitions. When enabled, Ionic will move focus to the correct element as specified in the config option. This will inform screen readers that a navigation event occurred.

### Types

```typescript
type FocusManagerPriority = 'content' | 'heading' | 'banner';
```

### Content Types

The following table explains what each content type represents:

| Type      | Description                   | Ionic Component           | Semantic HTML Equivalent                                                     | Landmark Equivalent                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| --------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `content` | The main portion of the view. | [Content](../api/content) | [`main`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/main)     | [`role="main"`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/Main_role)                                                                                                                      |
| `heading` | The title of the view.        | [Title](../api/title)     | [`h1`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/h1)         | [`role="heading"`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/heading_role) with [`aria-level="1"`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-level) |
| `banner`  | The header of the view.       | [Header](../api/header)   | [`header`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/header) | [`role="banner"`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/Banner_Role)                                                                                                                  |

:::important
Developers should assign `role="heading"` and `aria-level="1"` to the primary [Title](../api/title) on each view. Since multiple [Title](../api/title) components can be used in a single view, Ionic does not automatically assign these attributes.
:::

### Specifying Priority

The config should be specified in order of decreasing priority. In the following example, Ionic will always focus headings to start. Ionic only proceeds to the next focus priority, banner, if a view does not have a heading:

```js
focusManagerPriority: ['heading', 'banner'];
```

### Implementation Notes

- When specifying a focus priority, browsers may still move focus within that focus priority. For example, when specifying a `'content'` focus priority, Ionic will move focus to the content. However, the browser may then move focus within that content to the first focusable element such as a button.
- If none of the focus priorities are found in a view, Ionic will instead focus the view itself to ensure focus generally moves to the correct place. Browsers may then adjust focus within the view.
- When navigating from the current view to the previous view, Ionic will move focus back to the element that presented the current view.
- The focus manager can be overridden on a per-view basis as shown in [Manual Focus Management with Routing](#routing).

  <title>Previewing: To Run Ionic Apps Locally in A Web Browser</title>
  <meta
    name="description"
    content="Previewing provides many different options to test native functionality based on needs. Use this feature to easily run your Ionic app locally in a web browser."
  />
</head>

There are many different options to test native functionality depending on your target platforms and needs.

- Run locally in a web browser (using [Platform Detection](../core-concepts/cross-platform.md) for native functionality)
- [Deploy to iOS](ios.md)
- [Deploy to Android](android.md)

## Run Locally in a Web Browser

One of the most powerful features of Ionic is that the majority of your app development can happen right in a browser on your desktop. With full access to traditional web development tools (Chrome/Safari/Firefox dev tools), you can write code then test/debug it quickly without having to recompile or deploy to a simulator or device.

To do so, run `ionic serve` from the command line in the project's directory:

```shell-session
$ ionic serve
> ng run app:serve --host=0.0.0.0 --port=8100

[INFO] Development server running!

       Local: http://localhost:8100
       External: http://192.168.1.169:8100

       Use Ctrl+C to quit this process

[INFO] Browser window opened to http://localhost:8100!
```

With `ionic serve` running, continue developing your app. As you save changes, the app reloads with those changes applied.

:::note

If the external link isn't listed on the terminal, then run `ionic serve --external` to generate it.

:::

When implementing native functionality, use [Platform Detection](../core-concepts/cross-platform.md).
When you're ready to test on a real device, see here for [iOS](ios.md) and [Android](android.md).

## Simulating a Mobile Viewport

Each major browser vendor includes developer tools for mobile emulation. These tools offer the ability to change the emulated device type.

### Chrome

Open your application at the local or remote address that it is being served from. For example, `http://localhost:4200`. Then, open the Chrome developer tools by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+I` on Windows/Linux or `Cmd+Opt+I` on Mac.

<img src="/docs/img/developing/previewing/chrome-dev-tools.png" alt="Chrome Dev Tools" />

From here you can select different device types from the dropdown, change the orientation of the device and throttle the network speed.

For additional features and information visit: https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/device-mode/.

### Safari

:::note

Prerequisites: Show Develop menu in menu bar option must be enabled in Safari Advanced options.

:::

Open your application at the local or remote address that it is being served from. For example, `http://localhost:4200`. Select the **Develop** menu in Safari and select **Enter Responsive Design Mode** . Alternatively you can use the keyboard shortcut `Cmd+Opt+R`.

<img src="/docs/img/developing/previewing/safari-responsive-design-mode.png" alt="Safari Responsive Design Mode" />

From here you can select different device types to emulate as well as change the orientation of the device.

For additional features and information visit: https://developer.apple.com/safari/tools/.

### Firefox

Open your application at the local or remote address that it is being served from. For example, `http://localhost:4200`. Then, open the Firefox developer tools by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+M` on Windows/Linux or `Cmd+Opt+M` on Mac.

<img src="/docs/img/developing/previewing/firefox-responsive-design-mode.png" alt="Firefox Responsive Design Mode" />

From here you can select different device types from the dropdown, change the orientation of the device and throttle the network speed.

  />
</head>

Once an app is created by the Ionic CLI, the next step is to start building out features and components. The majority of the app will be developed in the `src/app/` directory.

## Project Structure

```bash
src/
├── app/
├── assets/
├── environments/
├── theme/
├── global.scss
├── index.html
├── main.ts
├── polyfills.ts
├── test.ts
└── zone-flags.ts
```

The `src/` directory has items such as the `index.html` file, configuration files for tests, an asset folder for images, and the main `app/` directory for the app's code.

```bash
src/
└── app/
    ├── app-routing.module.ts
    ├── app.component.html
    ├── app.component.spec.ts
    ├── app.component.ts
    └── app.module.ts
```

The `src/app/` directory contains the root app component and module as well as additional directories that contain app features such as pages, components, services, etc.

## Generating New Features

:::note
This command is only supported in Ionic Angular.
:::

The Ionic CLI can generate new app features with the [`ionic generate`](../cli/commands/generate.md) command. By running `ionic generate` in the command line, a selection prompt is displayed which lists the available features that can be generated.

```shell-session
$ ionic generate
? What would you like to generate?
❯ page
  component
  service
  module
  class
  directive
  guard
```

After a selection is made, the Ionic CLI will prompt for a name. The name can be a path, allowing easy generation of features within an organized project structure.

:::note
Any level of nesting is allowed, such as `portfolio/intro`. You can easily scope components to pages by using `ionic g component "portfolio/intro/About Me"`, for example.
:::

```shell-session
$ ionic generate
? What would you like to generate? page
? Name/path of page: portfolio █
```

Alternatively, the `type` and `name` of the generated feature can be entered on the command line:

```shell-session
$ ionic g page "User Detail"
> ng generate page "User Detail"
CREATE src/app/user-detail/user-detail.module.ts (564 bytes)
CREATE src/app/user-detail/user-detail.page.scss (0 bytes)
CREATE src/app/user-detail/user-detail.page.html (138 bytes)
CREATE src/app/user-detail/user-detail.page.spec.ts (720 bytes)
CREATE src/app/user-detail/user-detail.page.ts (280 bytes)
UPDATE src/app/app-routing.module.ts (475 bytes)
[OK] Generated page!
```

The Ionic CLI uses the underlying framework tooling to stay close to best practices. For `@ionic/angular`, the Angular CLI is used under the hood.

After creating the files and directories for the new page, the CLI will also update the router configuration to include the new page. This reduces the amount of manual work needed to keep the development lifecycle moving.

For more details, run `ionic g --help` from the command line or see [the documentation](../cli/commands/generate.md) for `ionic generate`.

</head>

Starting a new Ionic app is incredibly simple. From the command line, run the `ionic start` command and the CLI will handle the rest.

```shell-session
$ ionic start

Every great app needs a name! 😍

Please enter the full name of your app. You can change this at any time.
To bypass this prompt next time, supply name,
the first argument to ionic start.

? Project name: █
```

The Ionic CLI will display prompts asking for the new project's name and which template to use. These details can be provided as command arguments:

```shell-session
$ ionic start myApp tabs
```

Here, `myApp` is the name of the project, `tabs` is the starter template, and the project type is `angular`.

`tabs` is not the only project template available. Between all project types, there are three templates available:

- `tabs`: A tabs based layout
- `sidemenu`: A sidemenu based layout
- `blank`: An empty project with a single page

See all available templates with the following command:

```shell-session
$ ionic start --list
```

These templates provide a great starting point for any app and include all the best practices for making a code base scale.

  <title>App Development Tips: How to Resolve Permission Errors and Issues</title>
  <meta
    name="description"
    content="If errors occur, npm may need to be set up to operate without elevated permissions. Read our Ionic app Development Tips for more on resolving permission issues."
  />
</head>

## Resolving Permission Errors

`EACCES` permission errors can occur when packages are installed globally. If this is the case, npm may need to be set up to operate without elevated permissions.

:::note
Using `sudo` with npm is **not recommended** because it can lead to further complications.
:::

This guide offers two options for resolving permission issues. See the [npm docs](https://docs.npmjs.com/resolving-eacces-permissions-errors-when-installing-packages-globally) for full documentation and additional options.

### Option 1

The best way to avoid permission issues is to reinstall NodeJS and npm using a node version manager.

This guide will document [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) installation and usage. See the [nvm docs](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installation-and-update) for full documentation. See the [npm docs](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm#using-a-node-version-manager-to-install-nodejs-and-npm) for additional options and instructions for Windows.

1. Install nvm.

   ```shell
   $ curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.34.0/install.sh | bash
   ```

1. New terminals will now use nvm. To verify, open a new terminal and run the following. If something prints, the installation was successful.

   ```shell
   $ command -v nvm
   ```

1. To download and install the latest LTS release of NodeJS, run:

   ```shell
   $ nvm install --lts
   ```

1. Set the newly installed NodeJS as the default environment:

   ```shell
   $ nvm alias default lts/*
   ```

1. New terminals will now use the nvm-controlled NodeJS. To verify:

   ```shell
   $ node -v  # will print the version installed above
   $ which npm  # will print a path somewhere within the ~/.nvm folder
   ```

Global packages will now be installed in the `~/.nvm` directory, so permission errors should no longer occur as long as `npm` is used _without_ `sudo`.

### Option 2

<small>
  <em>Does not apply to Windows</em>
</small>

Change the owner of npm's directories to the current user:

```shell
$ sudo chown -R $(whoami) /usr/local/{lib/node_modules,bin,share}
$ sudo chown -R $(whoami) /usr/lib/node_modules
$ sudo chown -R $(whoami) ~/.npm ~/.npmrc
```

Since these global directories are no longer owned by `root`, packages can be installed globally _without_ `sudo`.

## Updating Dependencies

To update an [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) dependency, run the following, where `<package-name>` is the package to update:

```shell
npm install <package-name>@<version|latest> --save
```

For example, to update the `@ionic/angular` package to the release tagged `latest`, run:

```shell
npm install @ionic/angular@latest --save
```

It is recommended that packages get updated through the CLI since npm will now read package versions from the `package-lock.json` first.

## Code Editors

There are a lot of code editors to choose from. Here are some of our favorites:

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com): a popular and free text editor made by Microsoft
- [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/): a powerful non-free editor by JetBrains

## Using a Debugger

The `debugger` keyword can be used to debug an app. When most browsers encounters a `debugger` statement, running of JavaScript is stopped, and the browser will load its debugger. This can be used to set "breakpoints" in the app.

For example, if a function is not returning the correct value, the debugger can be used to step through the code and inspect variables.

```javascript
function myBrokenFunction() {
  debugger;
  // do other stuff
}
```

When an app runs, it will pause at this function. From there, the developer tools can be used to run pieces of JavaScript, line by line, and inspect where exactly the function breaks.

## Changing Mode

By default, when an app is viewed in the browser, Ionic will apply the `md` mode. However, since Ionic components adapt according to their platform, it is helpful to be able to view what the app will look like on iOS. To do this, add `?ionic:mode=ios` to the URL where the app is being served. For example, if the app is served on port `8100`, the url would be: `http://localhost:8100/?ionic:mode=ios`.

:::note
This will not change which platform the browser sees being used. The platform is determined by device detection and inspecting the user-agent. To change the platform, the user-agent must be changed. To do this, open up Chrome DevTools with <kbd>Ctrl+Shift+I</kbd>(<kbd>Cmd+Option+I</kbd> on Mac), and then toggle device mode on with <kbd>Ctrl+Shift+M</kbd>(<kbd>Cmd+Option+M</kbd> on Mac).
:::

![Chrome DevTools showing the device mode with iPhone X selected.](/img/faq/tips/change-device-platform.png 'Chrome DevTools Device Mode')

Selecting devices from the device dropdown will change the user-agent, as well as the dimensions of the viewport.

## Using the iOS Simulator

The iOS simulator enables testing and debugging of an app before it reaches an actual device.

Before it can be used, [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/download/), Apple's IDE, must be installed.

The [Ionic CLI](../cli.md) can then be used to run the app in the current directory on the simulator:

```shell
ionic cordova emulate ios -lc
```

Passing in the `-lc` flag will enable livereload and log console output to a terminal.

Xcode can also be used to launch the emulator and debug an app.

Open up Xcode and open `../path-to-app/platforms/ios/myApp.xcodeproj`.

After the app loads, console output and device logs will be printed inside of Xcode's output window.

## Using the Genymotion Android Emulator

While the Android SDK comes with a stock emulator, it can be slow and unresponsive at times.

[Genymotion](https://www.genymotion.com) is an alternate emulator that is faster, and still allows access to native functionality like GPS and camera.

## Overview

Ionic focuses on the frontend UX and UI interaction of an app — UI controls, interactions, gestures, animations. It's easy to learn, and integrates with other libraries or frameworks, such as [Angular](angular/overview.md), [React](react/overview.md), or [Vue](vue/overview.md). Alternatively, it can be used standalone without any frontend framework using a simple [script include](intro/cdn.md). If you’d like to learn more about Ionic before diving in, we <a href="https://youtu.be/p3AN3igqiRc" target="_blank">created a video</a> to walk you through the basics.

### One codebase, running everywhere

Ionic is the only mobile app stack that enables web developers to build apps for all major app stores and the mobile web from a single codebase. And with [Adaptive Styling](theming/platform-styles.md), Ionic apps look and feel at home on every device.

### A focus on performance

Ionic is built to perform and behave great on the latest mobile devices with best practices like efficient hardware accelerated transitions, and touch-optimized gestures.

### Clean, simple, and functional design

Ionic is designed to work and display beautifully on all current mobile devices and platforms. With ready-made components, typography, and a gorgeous (yet extensible) base theme that adapts to each platform, you'll be building in style.

### Native and Web optimized

Ionic emulates native app UI guidelines and uses native SDKs, bringing the UI standards and device features of native apps together with the full power and flexibility of the open web. Ionic uses Capacitor (or Cordova) to deploy natively, or runs in the browser as a Progressive Web App.

## Goals

### Cross-platform

Build and deploy apps that work across multiple platforms, such as native iOS, Android, and the web as a Progressive Web App - all with one code base. Write once, run anywhere.

### Web Standards-based

Ionic is built on top of reliable, [standardized web technologies](reference/glossary.md#web-standards): HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, using modern Web APIs such as Custom Elements and Shadow DOM. Because of this, Ionic components have a stable API, and aren't at the whim of a single platform vendor.

### Beautiful Design

Clean, simple, and functional. Ionic is designed to work and display beautifully out-of-the-box across all platforms.
Start with pre-designed components, typography, interactive paradigms, and a gorgeous (yet extensible) base theme.

### Simplicity

Ionic is built with simplicity in mind, so that creating apps is enjoyable, easy to learn, and accessible to just about anyone with web development skills.

## Framework Compatibility

While past releases of Ionic were tightly coupled to Angular, version 4.x of the framework was re-engineered to work as a standalone <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components" target="_blank">Web Component</a> library, with integrations for the latest JavaScript frameworks, like Angular. Ionic can be used in most frontend frameworks with success, including React and Vue, though some frameworks need a shim for full Web Component support.

### JavaScript

One of the main goals with moving Ionic to <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components" target="_blank">Web Components</a> was to remove any hard requirement on a single framework to host the components. This made it possible for the core components to work standalone in a web page with just a script tag. While working with frameworks can be great for larger teams and larger apps, it is now possible to use Ionic as a standalone library in a single page even in a context like WordPress.

### Angular

Angular has always been at the center of what makes Ionic great. While the core components have been written to work as a standalone Web Component library, the `@ionic/angular` package makes integration with the Angular ecosystem a breeze. `@ionic/angular` includes all the functionality that Angular developers would expect coming from Ionic 2/3, and integrates with core Angular libraries, like the Angular router.

### React

Ionic now has official support for the popular React library. Ionic React lets React developers use their existing web skills to build apps that target iOS, Android, and the web. With `@ionic/react`, you can use all the core Ionic components, but in a way that feels like using native React components.

### Vue

Ionic now has official support for the popular Vue 3 library. Ionic Vue lets Vue developers use their existing web skills to build apps that target iOS, Android, and the web. With `@ionic/vue`, you can use all the core Ionic components, but in a way that feels like using native Vue components.

### Future Support

Support for other frameworks will be considered in future releases.

## Ionic CLI

The official [Ionic CLI](cli.md), or Command Line Interface, is a tool that quickly scaffolds Ionic apps and provides a number of helpful commands to Ionic developers. In addition to installing and updating Ionic, the CLI comes with a built-in development server, build and debugging tools, and much more. If you are an [Appflow](#appflow) member, the CLI can be used to perform cloud builds and deployments, and administer your account.

## Appflow

To help build, deploy, and manage Ionic apps throughout their lifecycle, we offer a commercial service for production apps called <a href="https://ionic.io/appflow" target="_blank">Appflow</a>, which is <strong>separate from the open source Framework.</strong>

Appflow helps developers and teams compile native app builds and deploy live code updates to Ionic apps from a centralized dashboard. Optional paid upgrades are available for more advanced capabilities like publishing directly to app stores, workflow automation, single sign-on (SSO) and access to connected services and integrations.

Appflow requires an <a href="https://dashboard.ionicframework.com/signup" target="_blank">Ionic Account</a> and comes with a free “Hobby” plan for those interested in playing around with some of its features.

## Ecosystem

Ionic is actively developed and maintained full-time by a core team, and its ecosystem is guided by an international community of developers and contributors fueling its growth and adoption. Developers and companies small and large use Ionic to build and ship amazing apps that run everywhere.

### Join the Community

There are millions of Ionic developers in over 200 countries worldwide. Here are some ways to join:

  />
</head>

Ionic provides different packages that can be used to quickly get started using Ionic Framework or Ionicons in a test environment, Angular, any other framework, or none at all.

## Ionic Framework CDN

Ionic Framework can be included from a CDN for quick testing in a [Plunker](https://plnkr.co/), [Codepen](https://codepen.io), or any other online code editor!

It's recommended to use [jsdelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com/) to access the Framework from a CDN. To get the latest version, add the following inside the `<head>` element in an HTML file, or where external assets are included in the online code editor:

```html
<script type="module" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@ionic/core/dist/ionic/ionic.esm.js"></script>
<script nomodule src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@ionic/core/dist/ionic/ionic.js"></script>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@ionic/core/css/ionic.bundle.css" />
```

With this it's possible to use all of the Ionic Framework core components without having to install a framework. The CSS bundle will include all of the Ionic [Global Stylesheets](../layout/global-stylesheets).

:::note
This does not install Angular or any other frameworks. This allows use of the Ionic Framework core components without a framework.
:::

## Ionic + Angular

When using Ionic Framework in an Angular project, install the latest `@ionic/angular` package from [npm](../reference/glossary.md#npm). This comes with all of the Ionic Framework components and Angular specific services and features.

```shell
npm install @ionic/angular@latest --save
```

Each time there is a new Ionic Framework release, this [version](../reference/versioning.md) will need to be updated to get the latest features and fixes. The version can be [updated using npm](../developing/tips.md#updating-dependencies), as well.

For adding Ionic to an already existing Angular project, use the Angular CLI's `ng add` feature.

```shell
ng add @ionic/angular
```

This will add the necessary imports to the `@ionic/angular` package as well as add the styles needed.

## Ionic + React

To add Ionic Framework to an already existing React project, install the `@ionic/react` and `@ionic/react-router` package.

```shell
$ npm install @ionic/react
$ npm install @ionic/react-router
```

### CSS

To include the necessary CSS in a React project, add the following to the root App component.

```javascript
/* Core CSS required for Ionic components to work properly */
import '@ionic/react/css/core.css';

/* Basic CSS for apps built with Ionic */
import '@ionic/react/css/normalize.css';
import '@ionic/react/css/structure.css';
import '@ionic/react/css/typography.css';

/* Optional CSS utils that can be commented out */
import '@ionic/react/css/padding.css';
import '@ionic/react/css/float-elements.css';
import '@ionic/react/css/text-alignment.css';
import '@ionic/react/css/text-transformation.css';
import '@ionic/react/css/flex-utils.css';
import '@ionic/react/css/display.css';
```

## Ionic + Vue

To add Ionic Framework to an existing Vue project, install the `@ionic/vue` and `@ionic/vue-router` packages.

```shell
npm install @ionic/vue @ionic/vue-router
```

After that, you will need to install the `IonicVue` plugin in your Vue app.

**main.js**

```javascript
import { IonicVue } from '@ionic/vue';

import App from './App.vue';
import router from './router';

const app = createApp(App).use(IonicVue).use(router);

router.isReady().then(() => {
  app.mount('#app');
});
```

Be sure to mount your app once `router.isReady()` has resolved.

### Routing

When setting up routing in your Vue app, you will need to import your dependencies from `@ionic/vue-router` instead of `vue-router`.

**router/index.js**

```javascript
import { createRouter, createWebHistory } from '@ionic/vue-router';

const routes = [
  // routes go here
];

const router = createRouter({
  history: createWebHistory(process.env.BASE_URL),
  routes,
});

export default router;
```

### CSS

To include the necessary CSS in a Vue project, add the following to your `main.js` file.

```javascript
/* Core CSS required for Ionic components to work properly */
import '@ionic/vue/css/core.css';

/* Basic CSS for apps built with Ionic */
import '@ionic/vue/css/normalize.css';
import '@ionic/vue/css/structure.css';
import '@ionic/vue/css/typography.css';

/* Optional CSS utils that can be commented out */
import '@ionic/vue/css/padding.css';
import '@ionic/vue/css/float-elements.css';
import '@ionic/vue/css/text-alignment.css';
import '@ionic/vue/css/text-transformation.css';
import '@ionic/vue/css/flex-utils.css';
import '@ionic/vue/css/display.css';
```

From here, you can learn about how to develop with Ionic Framework in our [Ionic Vue Quickstart Guide](https://ionicframework.com/docs/vue/quickstart).

## Ionicons CDN

Ionicons is packaged by default with the Ionic Framework, so no installation is necessary if you're using Ionic. To use Ionicons without Ionic Framework, place the following `<script>` near the end of your page, right before the closing `</body>` tag.

```html
<script type="module" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/ionicons/dist/ionicons/ionicons.esm.js"></script>
<script nomodule src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/ionicons/dist/ionicons/ionicons.js"></script>
```

:::note
See [Ionicons usage](https://ionic.io/ionicons/usage) for more information on using Ionicons.

    name="description"
    content="The Ionic CLI is the preferred method of installation—offering a wide range of dev tools and help options. Learn how to install Ionic and begin building apps."
  />
</head>

Ionic apps are created and developed primarily through the Ionic [command-line](../reference/glossary.md#cli) utility. The Ionic CLI is the preferred method of installation, as it offers a wide range of dev tools and help options along the way. It is also the main tool through which to run the app and connect it to other services, such as Appflow.

<AppWizard />

## Install the Ionic CLI

Before proceeding, make sure your computer has [Node.js](../reference/glossary.md#node) installed. See [these instructions](environment.md) to set up an environment for Ionic.

Install the Ionic CLI with npm:

```shell
npm install -g @ionic/cli
```

If there was a previous installation of the Ionic CLI, it will need to be uninstalled due to a change in package name.

```shell
$ npm uninstall -g ionic
$ npm install -g @ionic/cli

```

:::note
The `-g` option means _install globally_. When packages are installed globally, `EACCES` permission errors can occur.
Consider setting up npm to operate globally without elevated permissions. See [Resolving Permission Errors](../developing/tips.md#resolving-permission-errors) for more information.
:::

## Start an App

Create an Ionic app using one of the pre-made app templates, or a blank one to start fresh. The three most common starters are the `blank` starter, `tabs` starter, and `sidemenu` starter. Get started with the `ionic start` command:

```shell
ionic start
```

![Three thumbnail previews of Ionic app templates: blank, tabs, and side menu.](/img/installation/start-app-thumbnails.png 'Ionic App Starter Templates')

To learn more about starting Ionic apps, see the [Starting Guide](../developing/starting.md).

## Run the App

The majority of Ionic app development can be spent right in the browser using the `ionic serve` command:

```shell
$ cd myApp
$ ionic serve
```

There are a number of other ways to run an app, it's recommended to start with this workflow. To develop and test apps on devices and emulators, see the [Running an App Guide](../developing/previewing.md).

  />
</head>

To get started with Ionic Framework, the only requirement is a [Node & npm](#node--npm) environment.

Of course, a code editor is also required. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is recommended. Visual Studio Code is a free, batteries-included text editor made by Microsoft.

## Terminal

:::note
Much of Ionic development requires familiarity with the command line. If you're new to the command line, see [this Blog Post](https://ionicframework.com/blog/new-to-the-command-line/) for a quick introduction.
:::

In general, we recommend using the built-in terminals. Many third-party terminals work well with Ionic, but may not be supported.

- For Windows, **Command Prompt** and **PowerShell** are supported. <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/faq" target="_blank">WSL</a> is known to work with Ionic, but may not be supported.
- For macOS, the built-in **Terminal** app is supported.

Git Bash (from <a href="https://git-scm.com" target="_blank">git-scm.com</a>) does not support TTY interactivity and is **not supported** by Ionic.

## Node & npm

Almost all tooling for modern JavaScript projects is based in [Node.js](../reference/glossary.md#node). The [download page](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) has prebuilt installation packages for all platforms. We recommend selecting the LTS version to ensure best compatibility.

Node is bundled with [npm](../reference/glossary.md#npm), the package manager for JavaScript.

To verify the installation, open a new terminal window and run:

```shell
$ node --version
$ npm --version
```

:::note
Permission errors are common on macOS when installing global packages with `npm`. If you get an `EACCES` error, see [Resolving Permission Errors](../developing/tips.md#resolving-permission-errors).
:::

## Git

Although not required, the version control system [Git](../reference/glossary.md#git) is highly recommended.

Git is often accompanied by a Git Host, such as [GitHub](https://github.com/), in which case additional setup is required. Follow the tutorial from the Git Host's documentation to set up Git:

- GitHub: [Set up Git](https://help.github.com/en/articles/set-up-git)
- GitLab: [Installing Git](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/topics/git/how_to_install_git)
- Bitbucket: [Install Git](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/install-git)

Otherwise, follow the [official installation instructions](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git). The command-line utility can be downloaded from the [download page](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

To verify the installation, open a new terminal window and run:

```shell
git --version
```

### Git GUI

Git is a command-line utility, but there are many [GUI clients](https://git-scm.com/downloads/guis/) available. [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) is recommended, and works well with GitHub.

`@ionic/core` brings the full power of the Ionic Framework to JavaScript developers. It offers seamless integration with the JavaScript ecosystem, so you can build high-quality cross-platform apps using familiar JavaScript tools, components, and best practices. You also get access to Ionic's extensive UI library and native capabilities.

## JavaScript Version Support

Ionic Core supports the latest versions of JavaScript. For detailed information on supported JavaScript runtime versions, see the [Stencil Support Policy](https://stenciljs.com/docs/support-policy#javascript-runtime).

## JavaScript Tooling

Ionic Core works seamlessly with modern JavaScript tooling and build systems. You can use popular tools like Vite, Webpack, or Parcel to scaffold and build your apps. Ionic Core is designed to fit naturally into the JavaScript ecosystem, so you can use your favorite libraries for state management, testing, and more.

## Native Tooling

[Capacitor](https://capacitorjs.com) is the official cross-platform runtime for Ionic Core, enabling your apps to run natively on iOS, Android, and the web with a single codebase.

## Installation

Before you begin, make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (which includes npm) installed on your machine.

```shell-session
$ npm create vite@latest my-app -- --template vanilla

$ cd my-app
$ npm install && npm install @ionic/core
$ npm run dev █
```

Welcome! This guide will walk you through the basics of Ionic JavaScript development using Vite. You'll learn how to set up your development environment, create a simple project, explore the project structure, and understand how Ionic components work. This is perfect for getting familiar with Ionic JavaScript before building your first real app.

If you're looking for a high-level overview of what Ionic JavaScript is and how it fits into the web development ecosystem, see the [Ionic JavaScript Overview](overview).

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine.
You can check by running:

```shell
node -v
npm -v
```

If you don't have Node.js and npm, [download Node.js here](https://nodejs.org/en/download) (which includes npm).

## Create a Project with Vite

First, create a new Vite project with vanilla JavaScript:

```shell
npm create vite@latest my-app -- --template vanilla

cd my-app
```

Install the project dependencies and Ionic Core:

```shell
npm install
npm install @ionic/core
```

After installation, start the development server:

```shell
npm run dev
```

Open your browser and visit the URL shown in the console.

## Explore the Project Structure

Your new app's directory will look like this:

```shell
├── index.html
└── src/
    ├── counter.js
    ├── main.js
    └── style.css
```

:::warning Delete files
The `counter.js` and `style.css` files can be deleted. We will not be using them.
:::

:::info
All file paths in the examples below are relative to the project root directory.
:::

Let's configure the project, initialize Ionic, and add components to create our app.

## Configure Vite

Install the `vite-plugin-static-copy` package:

```shell
npm install vite-plugin-static-copy --save-dev
```

Add a `vite.config.js` file at the project root with the following:

```js
import { defineConfig } from 'vite';
import { viteStaticCopy } from 'vite-plugin-static-copy';

export default defineConfig({
  optimizeDeps: {
    exclude: ['@ionic/core'],
  },
  build: {
    rollupOptions: {
      output: {
        manualChunks: undefined,
      },
      external: ['/ionic.esm.js'],
    },
  },
  plugins: [
    viteStaticCopy({
      targets: [
        {
          src: 'node_modules/@ionic/core/dist/ionic/*',
          dest: '',
        },
      ],
    }),
  ],
});
```

This copies the necessary Ionic files that Capacitor will need to work with lazy loaded Ionic components.

## Initialize Ionic

Replace the contents of `src/main.js` with the following:

```js
// Determine if the app is running in Capacitor
const isCapacitor = location.protocol === 'capacitor:' || (window.Capacitor && window.Capacitor.platform !== 'web');

// Load Ionic
if (isCapacitor) {
  // In Capacitor, import Ionic directly from copied dist files
  import(/* @vite-ignore */ location.origin + '/ionic.esm.js');
} else {
  // In the browser, use the normal loader
  import('@ionic/core/loader').then((m) => m.defineCustomElements(window));
}

// Core CSS required for Ionic components to work properly
import '@ionic/core/css/core.css';

// Basic CSS for apps built with Ionic
import '@ionic/core/css/normalize.css';
import '@ionic/core/css/structure.css';
import '@ionic/core/css/typography.css';

// Optional CSS utils that can be commented out
import '@ionic/core/css/padding.css';
import '@ionic/core/css/float-elements.css';
import '@ionic/core/css/text-alignment.css';
import '@ionic/core/css/text-transformation.css';
import '@ionic/core/css/flex-utils.css';
import '@ionic/core/css/display.css';
```

This initializes Ionic based on the environment and then imports all of the available CSS files.

## Add the App Component

Update your `index.html` to configure the metadata and use Ionic components:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en" dir="ltr">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <link rel="icon" type="image/svg+xml" href="/vite.svg" />
    <meta
      name="viewport"
      content="viewport-fit=cover, width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"
    />
    <title>my-app</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <ion-app>
      <ion-router>
        <ion-route url="/" component="home-page"></ion-route>
        <ion-route url="/new" component="new-page"></ion-route>
      </ion-router>
      <ion-router-outlet></ion-router-outlet>
    </ion-app>

    <script type="module" src="/src/main.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

This sets up the root of your application, using Ionic's `ion-app`, `ion-router`, and `ion-router-outlet` components. The key change is replacing the default `<div id="app">` with Ionic's routing and layout components. The router outlet is where your pages will be displayed.

## View Routes

Routes are defined in the `index.html` using `ion-route` components inside the `ion-router`:

```html
<ion-router>
  <ion-route url="/" component="home-page"></ion-route>
  <ion-route url="/new" component="new-page"></ion-route>
</ion-router>
```

When you visit the root URL (`/`), the `home-page` component will be loaded. When you visit the `/new` URL, the `new-page` component will be loaded. We will define these components next.

## Add the Home Page

Create a new directory called `pages` inside the `src` folder, then add a file called `HomePage.js` in that directory with the following content:

```js
class HomePage extends HTMLElement {
  connectedCallback() {
    this.innerHTML = `
      <ion-header>
        <ion-toolbar>
          <ion-title>Blank</ion-title>
        </ion-toolbar>
      </ion-header>
      <ion-content class="ion-padding">
        <div id="container">
          <strong>Ready to create an app?</strong>
          <p>
            Start with Ionic
            <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://ionicframework.com/docs/components">UI Components</a>
          </p>
        </div>
      </ion-content>
    `;
  }
}

customElements.define('home-page', HomePage);
```

This creates a custom element called `home-page` that contains the layout for your Home page. The page uses Ionic's layout components to create a header with a toolbar and scrollable content area.

:::tip Learn More
For detailed information about Ionic layout components, see the [Header](/docs/api/header), [Toolbar](/docs/api/toolbar), [Title](/docs/api/title), and [Content](/docs/api/content) documentation.
:::

Next, add a `<script>` tag before the `src/main.js` import in `index.html` to import the Home page:

```html
<script type="module">
  import './src/pages/HomePage.js';
</script>

<script type="module" src="/src/main.js"></script>
```

At this point your browser should be displaying the Home page.

![Screenshot of the Ionic Core Home page](/img/guides/quickstart/unstyled-home-page.png 'Ionic Core Home Component')

## Add an Ionic Component

You can enhance your Home page with more Ionic UI components. For example, add a [Button](/docs/api/button) to navigate to another page. Update the `HomePage` component in `src/pages/HomePage.js`:

```js
class HomePage extends HTMLElement {
  connectedCallback() {
    this.innerHTML = `
      <ion-header>
        <ion-toolbar>
          <ion-title>Blank</ion-title>
        </ion-toolbar>
      </ion-header>
      <ion-content class="ion-padding">
        <div id="container">
          <strong>Ready to create an app?</strong>
          <p>
            Start with Ionic
            <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://ionicframework.com/docs/components">UI Components</a>
          </p>
        </div>

        <ion-button>Navigate</ion-button>
      </ion-content>
    `;
  }
}

customElements.define('home-page', HomePage);
```

## Add a New Page

Add a new file named `NewPage.js` to `src/pages` with the following content:

```js
class NewPage extends HTMLElement {
  connectedCallback() {
    this.innerHTML = `
      <ion-header>
        <ion-toolbar>
          <ion-buttons slot="start">
            <ion-back-button default-href="/"></ion-back-button>
          </ion-buttons>
          <ion-title>New</ion-title>
        </ion-toolbar>
      </ion-header>
      <ion-content class="ion-padding">
        <h2>Welcome to the new page!</h2>
      </ion-content>
    `;
  }
}

customElements.define('new-page', NewPage);
```

This creates a page with a [Back Button](/docs/api/back-button) in the [Toolbar](/docs/api/toolbar). The back button will automatically handle navigation back to the previous page, or to `/` if there is no history.

Next, update the `<script>` tag which imports the Home page in the `index.html` file to also import the New page:

```html
<script type="module">
  import './src/pages/HomePage.js';
  import './src/pages/NewPage.js';
</script>
```

## Navigate to the New Page

To navigate to the new page, update the button in `src/pages/HomePage.js` to be inside of an `ion-router-link`:

```html
<ion-router-link href="/new">
  <ion-button>Navigate</ion-button>
</ion-router-link>
```

When the button is clicked, Ionic's router will automatically navigate to the `/new` route and display the `new-page` component.

:::info
Navigating can also be performed programmatically using `document.querySelector('ion-router').push('/new')`. See the [Ionic Router documentation](/docs/api/router) for more information.
:::

## Add Icons to the New Page

Ionic JavaScript comes with [Ionicons](https://ionic.io/ionicons/) support. To use icons, you need to import them, register them with `addIcons`, and then use them with the `ion-icon` component.

Add the necessary imports and register the icons in `src/main.js`:

```js
// ...Ionic initialization

// Icon imports
import { addIcons } from 'ionicons';
import { heart, logoIonic } from 'ionicons/icons';

addIcons({ heart, logoIonic });

// ...CSS imports
```

Next, update `src/pages/NewPage.js` to include the icons:

```js
class NewPage extends HTMLElement {
  connectedCallback() {
    this.innerHTML = `
      <ion-header>
        <ion-toolbar>
          <ion-buttons slot="start">
            <ion-back-button default-href="/"></ion-back-button>
          </ion-buttons>
          <ion-title>New</ion-title>
        </ion-toolbar>
      </ion-header>
      <ion-content class="ion-padding">
        <h2>Welcome to the new page!</h2>

        <ion-icon name="heart"></ion-icon>
        <ion-icon name="logo-ionic"></ion-icon>
      </ion-content>
    `;
  }
}

customElements.define('new-page', NewPage);
```

For more information, see the [Icon documentation](/docs/api/icon) and the [Ionicons documentation](https://ionic.io/ionicons/).

## Call Component Methods

Let's add a button that can scroll the content area to the bottom. Update `src/pages/NewPage.js` to include scrollable content and a scroll button:

```js
class NewPage extends HTMLElement {
  connectedCallback() {
    this.innerHTML = `
      <ion-header>
        <ion-toolbar>
          <ion-buttons slot="start">
            <ion-back-button default-href="/"></ion-back-button>
          </ion-buttons>
          <ion-title>New</ion-title>
        </ion-toolbar>
      </ion-header>
      <ion-content class="ion-padding">
        <h2>Welcome to the new page!</h2>

        <ion-icon name="heart"></ion-icon>
        <ion-icon name="logo-ionic"></ion-icon>

        <ion-button id="scroll-btn">Scroll to Bottom</ion-button>

        <!-- Add lots of content to make scrolling possible -->
        <div id="item-list"></div>
      </ion-content>
    `;

    // Generate items and add scroll functionality after the element is connected
    this.setupScrolling();
  }

  setupScrolling() {
    // Wait for ion-content to be ready
    customElements.whenDefined('ion-content').then(() => {
      // Generate items
      const itemList = this.querySelector('#item-list');
      for (let i = 1; i <= 50; i++) {
        const item = document.createElement('ion-item');
        const label = document.createElement('ion-label');
        label.textContent = `Item ${i}`;
        item.appendChild(label);
        itemList.appendChild(item);
      }

      // Add scroll functionality
      const scrollBtn = this.querySelector('#scroll-btn');
      const content = this.querySelector('ion-content');

      if (scrollBtn && content) {
        scrollBtn.addEventListener('click', () => {
          content.scrollToBottom(300);
        });
      }
    });
  }
}

customElements.define('new-page', NewPage);
```

To call methods on Ionic components:

1. Get a reference to the component element using `querySelector`
2. Call the method directly on the element

You can find available methods for each component in the [Methods](/docs/api/content#methods) section of their API documentation.

## Run on a Device

Ionic's components work everywhere: on iOS, Android, and PWAs. To deploy to mobile, use [Capacitor](https://capacitorjs.com):

```shell
npm install @capacitor/core @capacitor/cli @capacitor/ios @capacitor/android
npx cap init

npm run build

npx cap add ios
npx cap add android
```

Open the native projects in their IDEs:

```shell
npx cap open ios
npx cap open android
```

See [Capacitor's Getting Started guide](https://capacitorjs.com/docs/getting-started/with-ionic) for more.

## Framework Integrations

Ionic Core also works with other frameworks and libraries that support custom elements, such as [Alpine.js](https://alpinejs.dev/), [Lit](https://lit.dev/), and [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/). However, when using Ionic Core with these libraries, you won't have the built-in form and routing capabilities that are tightly coupled with Ionic's official Angular, React, and Vue framework integrations, and will need to use their respective routing and form solutions instead.

### Responsive Text Classes

All of the text classes listed above have additional classes to modify the text based on the screen size. Instead of `text-` in each class, use `text-{breakpoint}-` to only use the class on specific screen sizes, where `{breakpoint}` is one of the breakpoint names listed in [Ionic Breakpoints](#ionic-breakpoints).

The table below shows the default behavior, where `{modifier}` is any of the following: `left`, `right`, `start`, `end`, `center`, `justify`, `wrap`, `nowrap`, `uppercase`, `lowercase`, or `capitalize`, as they are described above.

| Class                     | Description                                                   |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `.ion-text-{modifier}`    | Applies the modifier to the element on all screen sizes.      |
| `.ion-text-sm-{modifier}` | Applies the modifier to the element when `min-width: 576px`.  |
| `.ion-text-md-{modifier}` | Applies the modifier to the element when `min-width: 768px`.  |
| `.ion-text-lg-{modifier}` | Applies the modifier to the element when `min-width: 992px`.  |
| `.ion-text-xl-{modifier}` | Applies the modifier to the element when `min-width: 1200px`. |

## Element Placement

### Float

The [float](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/float) CSS property specifies that an element should be placed along the left or right side of its container, where text and inline elements will wrap around it. This way, the element is taken from the normal flow of the web page, though still remaining a part of the flow, contrary to absolute positioning.

```html
<ion-grid>
  <ion-row>
    <ion-col>
      <h3>no float</h3>
      <img
        alt="Silhouette of a person's head"

      />

| ------------------ | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `.ion-float-left`  | `float: left`                  | The element will float on the left side of its containing block.                                        |

## Element Display

### Display

The [display](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/display) CSS property sets whether an element is treated as a block or inline box and the layout used for its children, such as flow layout, grid or flex. It can also be used to completely hide an element from the layout.

Ionic provides the following utility classes for `display`:

| Class                       | Style Rule              | Description                                                                                                                            |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `.ion-display-none`         | `display: none`         | Turns off the display of an element so that it has no effect on layout (the document is rendered as though the element did not exist). |
| `.ion-display-inline`       | `display: inline`       | The element behaves as an inline element that does not create line breaks before or after itself.                                      |
| `.ion-display-inline-block` | `display: inline-block` | The element behaves as a block element that flows with surrounding content as if it were a single inline box.                          |
| `.ion-display-block`        | `display: block`        | The element behaves as a block element, creating line breaks both before and after itself when in the normal flow.                     |
| `.ion-display-flex`         | `display: flex`         | The element behaves like a block element and lays out its content according to the flexbox model.                                      |
| `.ion-display-inline-flex`  | `display: inline-flex`  | The element behaves like an inline element and lays out its content according to the flexbox model.                                    |
| `.ion-display-grid`         | `display: grid`         | The element behaves like a block element and lays out its content according to the grid model.                                         |
| `.ion-display-inline-grid`  | `display: inline-grid`  | The element behaves like an inline element and lays out its content according to the grid model.                                       |
| `.ion-display-table`        | `display: table`        | The element behaves like an HTML `<table>` element. It defines a block-level box.                                                      |
| `.ion-display-table-cell`   | `display: table-cell`   | The element behaves like an HTML `<td>` element.                                                                                       |
| `.ion-display-table-row`    | `display: table-row`    | The element behaves like an HTML `<tr>` element.                                                                                       |

### Responsive Display Classes

All of the display classes listed above have additional classes to modify the display based on the screen size. Instead of `display-` in each class, use `display-{breakpoint}-` to only use the class on specific screen sizes, where `{breakpoint}` is one of the breakpoint names listed in [Ionic Breakpoints](#ionic-breakpoints).

The table below shows the default behavior, where `{modifier}` is any of the following: `none`, `inline`, `inline-block`, `block`, `flex`, `inline-flex`, `grid`, `inline-grid`, `table`, `table-cell`, `table-row`, as they are described above.

| Class                        | Description                                                   |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |

## Content Space

### Padding

The padding class sets the padding area of an element. The padding area is the space between the content of the element and its border.

The default amount of `padding` to be applied is `16px` and is set by the `--ion-padding` variable. See the [CSS Variables](../theming/css-variables.md) section for more information on how to change these values.

```html
<ion-grid>
  <ion-row>
    <ion-col class="ion-padding">
      <div>padding</div>
    </ion-col>
    <ion-col class="ion-padding-top">

Flexbox properties are divided into two categories: **container properties** that control the layout of all flex items, and **item properties** that control individual flex items. See [Flex Item Properties](#flex-item-properties) for item-level alignment.

<img src={require('@site/static/img/layout/diagram-flex-attributes.png').default} />

### Align Items

The [align-items](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/align-items) CSS property sets the [align-self](#align-self) value on all direct children as a group. In flexbox, it controls the alignment of items on the cross axis. In grid layout, it controls the alignment of items on the block axis within their grid areas.

<img src={require('@site/static/img/layout/align-items.png').default} />

Ionic provides the following utility classes for `align-items`:

| Class                       | Style Rule                | Description                                          |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `.ion-align-items-start`    | `align-items: flex-start` | Items are packed toward the start on the cross axis. |
| `.ion-align-items-end`      | `align-items: flex-end`   | Items are packed toward the end on the cross axis.   |
| `.ion-align-items-center`   | `align-items: center`     | Items are centered along the cross axis.             |
| `.ion-align-items-baseline` | `align-items: baseline`   | Items are aligned so that their baselines align.     |
| `.ion-align-items-stretch`  | `align-items: stretch`    | Items are stretched to fill the container.           |

### Align Content

The [align-content](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/align-content) CSS property sets the distribution of space between and around content items along a flexbox's cross axis, or a grid or block-level element's block axis.

This property has no effect on single line flex containers (i.e., ones with `flex-wrap: nowrap`).

<img src={require('@site/static/img/layout/align-content.png').default} />

Ionic provides the following utility classes for `align-content`:

| Class                        | Style Rule                     | Description                                                |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `.ion-align-content-start`   | `align-content: flex-start`    | Lines are packed toward the start of the cross axis.       |
| `.ion-align-content-end`     | `align-content: flex-end`      | Lines are packed toward the end of the cross axis.         |
| `.ion-align-content-center`  | `align-content: center`        | Lines are centered along the cross axis.                   |
| `.ion-align-content-stretch` | `align-content: stretch`       | Lines are stretched to fill the container.                 |
| `.ion-align-content-between` | `align-content: space-between` | Lines are evenly distributed on the cross axis.            |
| `.ion-align-content-around`  | `align-content: space-around`  | Lines are evenly distributed with equal space around them. |

### Justify Content

The [justify-content](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/justify-content) CSS property defines how the browser distributes space between and around content items along the main axis of a flex container and the inline axis of grid and multi-column containers.

<img src={require('@site/static/img/layout/justify-content.png').default} />

Ionic provides the following utility classes for `justify-content`:

| Class                          | Style Rule                       | Description                                                                 |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `.ion-justify-content-start`   | `justify-content: flex-start`    | Items are packed toward the start on the main axis.                         |
| `.ion-justify-content-end`     | `justify-content: flex-end`      | Items are packed toward the end on the main axis.                           |
| `.ion-justify-content-center`  | `justify-content: center`        | Items are centered along the main axis.                                     |
| `.ion-justify-content-around`  | `justify-content: space-around`  | Items are evenly distributed on the main axis with equal space around them. |
| `.ion-justify-content-between` | `justify-content: space-between` | Items are evenly distributed on the main axis.                              |
| `.ion-justify-content-evenly`  | `justify-content: space-evenly`  | Items are distributed so that the spacing between any two items is equal.   |

### Flex Direction

The [flex-direction](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/flex-direction) CSS property sets how flex items are placed in the flex container defining the main axis and the direction (normal or reversed).

<img src={require('@site/static/img/layout/flex-direction.png').default} />

Ionic provides the following utility classes for `flex-direction`:

| Class                      | Style Rule                       | Description                                                       |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `.ion-flex-row`            | `flex-direction: row`            | Items are placed in the same direction as the text direction.     |
| `.ion-flex-row-reverse`    | `flex-direction: row-reverse`    | Items are placed in the opposite direction as the text direction. |
| `.ion-flex-column`         | `flex-direction: column`         | Items are placed vertically.                                      |
| `.ion-flex-column-reverse` | `flex-direction: column-reverse` | Items are placed vertically in reverse order.                     |

### Flex Wrap

The [flex-wrap](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/flex-wrap) CSS property sets whether flex items are forced onto one line or can wrap onto multiple lines. If wrapping is allowed, it sets the direction that lines are stacked.

<img src={require('@site/static/img/layout/flex-wrap.png').default} />

Ionic provides the following utility classes for `flex-wrap`:

| Class                    | Style Rule                | Description                                              |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `.ion-flex-nowrap`       | `flex-wrap: nowrap`       | Items will all be on one line.                           |
| `.ion-flex-wrap`         | `flex-wrap: wrap`         | Items will wrap onto multiple lines, from top to bottom. |
| `.ion-flex-wrap-reverse` | `flex-wrap: wrap-reverse` | Items will wrap onto multiple lines, from bottom to top. |

### Responsive Flex Container Classes

All of the flex container classes listed above have additional classes to modify the properties based on the screen size. Instead of the base class name, use `{property}-{breakpoint}-{modifier}` to only use the class on specific screen sizes, where `{breakpoint}` is one of the breakpoint names listed in [Ionic Breakpoints](#ionic-breakpoints).

The table below shows the default behavior, where `{property}` is one of the following: `justify-content`, `align-content`, `align-items`, `flex`, or `flex-wrap`, and `{modifier}` is the corresponding value as described above.

| Class                           | Description                                                   |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `.ion-{property}-{modifier}`    | Applies the modifier to the element on all screen sizes.      |
| `.ion-{property}-sm-{modifier}` | Applies the modifier to the element when `min-width: 576px`.  |
| `.ion-{property}-md-{modifier}` | Applies the modifier to the element when `min-width: 768px`.  |
| `.ion-{property}-lg-{modifier}` | Applies the modifier to the element when `min-width: 992px`.  |
| `.ion-{property}-xl-{modifier}` | Applies the modifier to the element when `min-width: 1200px`. |

### Deprecated Classes

:::warning Deprecation Notice

The following classes are deprecated and will be removed in the next major release. Use the recommended `.ion-flex-*` classes instead.

:::

| Class               | Description                                                                                                          |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `.ion-nowrap`       | Items will all be on one line.<br />**Deprecated** — Use `.ion-flex-nowrap` instead.                                 |
| `.ion-wrap`         | Items will wrap onto multiple lines, from top to bottom.<br />**Deprecated** — Use `.ion-flex-wrap` instead.         |
| `.ion-wrap-reverse` | Items will wrap onto multiple lines, from bottom to top.<br />**Deprecated** — Use `.ion-flex-wrap-reverse` instead. |

## Flex Item Properties

Flex item properties control how individual flex items behave within their flex container. See also: [Flex Container Properties](#flex-container-properties) for container-level alignment.

### Align Self

The [align-self](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/align-self) CSS property overrides a grid or flex item's align-items value. In grid, it aligns the item inside the grid area. In flexbox, it aligns the item on the cross axis.

The property doesn't apply to block-level boxes, or to table cells. If a flexbox item's cross-axis margin is `auto`, then `align-self` is ignored.

<img src={require('@site/static/img/layout/align-self.png').default} />

Ionic provides the following utility classes for `align-self`:

| Class                      | Style Rule               | Description                                                            |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `.ion-align-self-start`    | `align-self: flex-start` | Item is packed toward the start on the cross axis.                     |
| `.ion-align-self-end`      | `align-self: flex-end`   | Item is packed toward the end on the cross axis.                       |
| `.ion-align-self-center`   | `align-self: center`     | Item is centered along the cross axis.                                 |
| `.ion-align-self-baseline` | `align-self: baseline`   | Item is aligned so that its baseline aligns with other item baselines. |
| `.ion-align-self-stretch`  | `align-self: stretch`    | Item is stretched to fill the container.                               |
| `.ion-align-self-auto`     | `align-self: auto`       | Item is positioned according to the parent's `align-items` value.      |

### Flex

The [flex](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/flex) CSS property is a shorthand property for `flex-grow`, `flex-shrink` and `flex-basis`. It sets how a flex item will grow or shrink to fit the space available in its flex container.

<img src={require('@site/static/img/layout/flex.png').default} />

Ionic provides the following utility classes for `flex`:

| Class               | Style Rule      | Description                                                 |
| ------------------- | --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `.ion-flex-1`       | `flex: 1`       | Item grows and shrinks equally with other flex items.       |
| `.ion-flex-auto`    | `flex: auto`    | Item grows and shrinks based on its content size.           |
| `.ion-flex-initial` | `flex: initial` | Item shrinks to its minimum content size but does not grow. |
| `.ion-flex-none`    | `flex: none`    | Item does not grow or shrink.                               |

### Flex Grow

The [flex-grow](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/flex-grow) CSS property sets the flex grow factor, which specifies how much of the flex container's positive free space, if any, should be assigned to the flex item's main size.

<img src={require('@site/static/img/layout/flex-grow.png').default} />

Ionic provides the following utility classes for `flex-grow`:

| Class              | Style Rule     | Description                                        |
| ------------------ | -------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `.ion-flex-grow-0` | `flex-grow: 0` | Item does not grow beyond its content size.        |
| `.ion-flex-grow-1` | `flex-grow: 1` | Item grows to fill available space proportionally. |

### Flex Shrink

The [flex-shrink](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/flex-shrink) CSS property sets the flex shrink factor of a flex item. If the size of all flex items is larger than the flex container, the flex items can shrink to fit according to their `flex-shrink` value. Each flex line's negative free space is distributed between the line's flex items that have a `flex-shrink` value greater than `0`.

<img src={require('@site/static/img/layout/flex-shrink.png').default} />

Ionic provides the following utility classes for `flex-shrink`:

| Class                | Style Rule       | Description                                              |
| -------------------- | ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `.ion-flex-shrink-0` | `flex-shrink: 0` | Item does not shrink below its content size.             |
| `.ion-flex-shrink-1` | `flex-shrink: 1` | Item shrinks proportionally when container is too small. |

### Order

The [order](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/order) CSS property sets the order to lay out an item in a flex or grid container. Items in a container are sorted by ascending `order` value and then by their source code order. Items not given an explicit `order` value are assigned the default value of `0`.

<img src={require('@site/static/img/layout/order.png').default} />

Ionic provides the following utility classes for `order`:

| Class              | Style Rule  | Description                               |
| ------------------ | ----------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `.ion-order-first` | `order: -1` | Item appears first in the flex container. |
| `.ion-order-0`     | `order: 0`  | Item appears in its natural order.        |
| `.ion-order-1`     | `order: 1`  | Item appears after items with order 0.    |
| `.ion-order-2`     | `order: 2`  | Item appears after items with order 1.    |
| `.ion-order-3`     | `order: 3`  | Item appears after items with order 2.    |
| `.ion-order-4`     | `order: 4`  | Item appears after items with order 3.    |
| `.ion-order-5`     | `order: 5`  | Item appears after items with order 4.    |
| `.ion-order-6`     | `order: 6`  | Item appears after items with order 5.    |
| `.ion-order-7`     | `order: 7`  | Item appears after items with order 6.    |
| `.ion-order-8`     | `order: 8`  | Item appears after items with order 7.    |
| `.ion-order-9`     | `order: 9`  | Item appears after items with order 8.    |
| `.ion-order-10`    | `order: 10` | Item appears after items with order 9.    |
| `.ion-order-11`    | `order: 11` | Item appears after items with order 10.   |
| `.ion-order-12`    | `order: 12` | Item appears after items with order 11.   |
| `.ion-order-last`  | `order: 13` | Item appears last in the flex container.  |

### Responsive Flex Item Classes

All of the flex item classes listed above have additional classes to modify the properties based on the screen size. Instead of the base class name, use `{property}-{breakpoint}-{modifier}` to only use the class on specific screen sizes, where `{breakpoint}` is one of the breakpoint names listed in [Ionic Breakpoints](#ionic-breakpoints).

The table below shows the default behavior, where `{property}` is one of the following: `align-self`, `flex`, `flex-grow`, `flex-shrink`, or `order`, and `{modifier}` is the corresponding value as described above.

| Class                           | Description                                                   |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `.ion-{property}-{modifier}`    | Applies the modifier to the element on all screen sizes.      |
| `.ion-{property}-sm-{modifier}` | Applies the modifier to the element when `min-width: 576px`.  |
| `.ion-{property}-md-{modifier}` | Applies the modifier to the element when `min-width: 768px`.  |
| `.ion-{property}-lg-{modifier}` | Applies the modifier to the element when `min-width: 992px`.  |
| `.ion-{property}-xl-{modifier}` | Applies the modifier to the element when `min-width: 1200px`. |

## Border Display

The `.ion-no-border` utility class can be used to remove borders from Ionic components. This class can be applied to the `ion-header` and `ion-footer` components.

```html
<ion-header class="ion-no-border">
  <ion-toolbar>
    <ion-title>Header - No Border</ion-title>
  </ion-toolbar>
</ion-header>

<ion-footer class="ion-no-border">
  <ion-toolbar>
    <ion-title>Footer - No Border</ion-title>
  </ion-toolbar>
</ion-footer>
```

| Class            | Description                      |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `.ion-no-border` | The element will have no border. |

## Ionic Breakpoints

Ionic uses breakpoints in media queries in order to style an application differently based on the screen size. The following breakpoint names are used in the utility classes listed above, where the class will apply when the width is met.

| Breakpoint Name | Width    |
| --------------- | -------- |
| `xs`            | `0`      |
| `sm`            | `576px`  |
| `md`            | `768px`  |
| `lg`            | `992px`  |
| `xl`            | `1200px` |

# Dynamic Font Scaling

Dynamic Font Scaling is a feature that allows users to choose the size of the text displayed on the screen. This helps users who need larger text for better readability, and it also accommodates users who can read smaller text.

## Try It Out

:::tip
Be sure to try this on an Android, iOS, or iPadOS device.

If you are testing on Chrome for Android, make sure ["Accessibility Page Zoom"](#chrome-for-android) is enabled.
:::

Follow the [Changing the Font Size on a Device](#changing-the-font-size-on-a-device) guide to set your preferred font size, and watch the text in the demo below grow or shrink according to your preferences.

import DynamicFontScaling from '@site/static/usage/v8/layout/dynamic-font-scaling/index.md';

<DynamicFontScaling />

## Using Dynamic Font Scaling

### Enabling in an Application

Dynamic Font Scaling is enabled by default as long as the [typography.css](/docs/layout/global-stylesheets#typographycss) file is imported. Importing this file will define the `--ion-dynamic-font` variable which will activate Dynamic Font Scaling. While not recommended, developers can opt-out of Dynamic Font Scaling by setting this variable to `initial` in their application code.

### Integrating Custom Components

Developers can configure their custom components to take advantage of Dynamic Font Scaling by converting any `font-size` declarations that use `px` units to use [rem units](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Values_and_units#lengths) instead. An easy way to convert from `px` to `rem` is to divide the pixel font size by the default browser font size, which is typically `16px`. For example, if a component has a font size of `14px`, then this could be converted to `rem` by doing `14px / 16px = 0.875rem`. Also note that any Ionic components that have had their font sizes overridden should also be updated to use `rem` units.

One thing to keep in mind is that the dimensions of your components may need to change to accommodate the larger font sizes. For example, `width` and `height` properties may need to change to `min-width` and `min-height`, respectively. Developers should audit their applications for any CSS properties that use [length values](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/length) and make any applicable conversions from `px` to `rem`. We also recommend having long text wrap to the next line instead of truncating to keep large text readable.

### Custom Font Family

We recommend using the default fonts in Ionic as they are designed to look good at any size and ensure consistency with other mobile apps. However, developers can use a custom font family with Dynamic Font Scaling via CSS:

```css
html {
  --ion-dynamic-font: var(--ion-default-dynamic-font);
  --ion-font-family: 'Comic Sans MS';
}
```

### `em` units versus `rem` units

Developers have two options for relative font sizes: [`em` and `rem`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Values_and_units#ems_and_rems).

`em` units set the font size of an element relative to the font size of its parent.

In the following example, the computed font size of `.child` is `40px` because it is a child of `.parent` (`2em * 20px = 40px`).

```css
.parent {
  font-size: 20px;
}

.child {
  font-size: 2em;
}
```

However, the `em` unit has a compounding effect which can cause issues. In the following example, the second `.child` element has a computed font size of `80px` since the font sizes compound.

```html
<div class="parent">
  Parent element with 20px
  <div class="child">
    Child element with 40px
    <div class="child">Child element with 80px</div>
  </div>
</div>
```

<div style={{ fontSize: '20px' }}>
  Parent element with 20px
  <div style={{ fontSize: '2em' }}>
    Child element with 40px
    <div style={{ fontSize: '2em' }}>Child element with 80px</div>
  </div>
</div>

Due to this compounding effect, we strongly recommend using `rem` units instead of `em` units when working with Dynamic Font Scaling. `rem` units set the font size of an element relative to the font size of the root element, which is typically `<html>`. The default font size of the root element is typically `16px`.

In the following example, the computed font size of `.child` is `32px` because the font size is being computed relative to `html`, not `.parent`.

```css
.parent {
  font-size: 20px;
}

.child {
  font-size: 2rem;
}
```

## How Dynamic Font Scaling works in Ionic

Ionic components that define font sizes and participate in Dynamic Font Scaling typically use [rem units](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Values_and_units#lengths). This sizes the text in each component relative to the font size of the root element, which is usually the `html` element. This means that as the root element's font size changes, the text in all Ionic components scale in a consistent manner. This avoids the need to manually override each component's font size. Some elements inside of these components, such as icons, use `em` units instead so the elements are sized relative to the text, though the text itself is sized using `rem` units.

### iOS

Dynamic Font Scaling in Ionic builds on top of an iOS feature called [Dynamic Type](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uifont/scaling_fonts_automatically#overview). To do this, Ionic sets the [font](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font) of the root element to an Apple-defined text style. For consistency, Ionic uses the [body](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uifont/textstyle/1616682-body) text style.

Using the Apple-defined text style enables Dynamic Type, allowing all text in Ionic components to scale according to the system-level preference. Note that these Apple-defined fonts only work on Apple devices. As a result, these fonts will not work on Android devices even if your app is using `ios` mode.

Ionic follows [Apple's Human Interface Guidelines for Typography](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/typography) when an app is in `ios` mode. As a result, important content is prioritized when the text size changes. This means a few things:

1. Content in an `ion-header` or an `ion-footer` will have maximum font sizes to prioritize content in `ion-content` which is deemed more important than content in the `ion-header` and `ion-footer`.
2. Components such as `ion-badge` and `ion-back-button` will have minimum font sizes so they remain readable.
3. Text in components such as `ion-tab-bar` and `ion-picker` do not participate in Dynamic Font Scaling according to Apple's Human Interface Guidelines.

### Android Web View

The Android Web View's font scaling mechanism is always enabled in web content and will automatically scale font sizes defined using the `px` unit. This means that any maximum or minimum font sizes specified using `px` will still be scaled even if the final font size does not align with the maximum or minimum font sizes specified.

In the following example we are using the [min()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/min) function to indicate that the font size of `.foo` should be no larger than `14px`.

```css
.foo {
  font-size: min(1rem, 14px);
}
```

If the root element's default font size is `16px`, and the system-level font scale is `1.5` (i.e text sizes should be increased by 50%), then `1rem` will evaluate to `24px` because `16 * 1.5 = 24`.

This is larger than our defined maximum of `14px`, so one might assume that the evaluated font size of `.foo` is `14px`. However, since the Android Web View scales any font sizes defined using the `px` unit, this means the `14px` used in our `min()` function will also be scaled by 1.5.

As a result, this means that the maximum computed font size is actually `21px` since `14 * 1.5 = 21` and therefore the overall computed font size of `.foo` is `21px`.

### Chrome for Android

The Chrome Web Browser on Android behaves differently than the Android Web View. By default, Chrome for Android does not respect the system-level font scale setting. However, the Chromium team is working on a new feature to allow for this. When enabled, this feature will change the `zoom` level of the `html` element which will cause the layout to increase in size in addition to the text.

Developers can test this behavior by enabling the experimental "Accessibility Page Zoom" feature in `chrome://flags`.

See https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=645717 for more information.

### Using Modes on Different Platforms

Each platform has slightly different font scaling behaviors, and the `ios` and `md` modes have been implemented to take advantage of the scaling behaviors on their respective platforms.

For example, `ios` mode makes use of maximum and minimum font sizes to follow [Apple's Human Interface Guidelines for Typography](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/typography). `md` mode does not implement this same behavior because Material Design does not have that same guidance. This means that using `md` mode on an iOS device may allow for very large font sizes in headers and footers.

As a result, we strongly recommend using `ios` mode on iOS devices and `md` mode on Android devices when using Dynamic Font Scaling.

## Changing the Font Size on a Device

Font scaling preferences are configured on a per-device basis by the user. This allows the user to scale the font for all applications that support this behavior. This guide shows how to enable font scaling for each platform.

### iOS

Font scaling on iOS can be configured in the Settings app.

See [Apple Support](https://support.apple.com/en-us/102453) for more information.

### Android

Where users access the font scaling configuration varies across devices, but it is typically found in the "Accessibility" page in the Settings app.

:::info
The Chrome Web Browser on Android has some limitations with respecting system-level font scales. See [Chrome for Android](#chrome-for-android) for more information.
:::

## Troubleshooting

### Dynamic Font Scaling is not working

There are a number of reasons why Dynamic Font Scaling may not have any effect on an app. The following list, while not exhaustive, provides some things to check to debug why Dynamic Font Scaling is not working.

1. Verify that your version of Ionic supports Dynamic Font Scaling. Dynamic Font Scaling was added starting in Ionic v7.5.
2. Verify that the [typography.css](/docs/layout/global-stylesheets#typographycss) file has been imported. This file is required for Dynamic Font Scaling to work.
3. Verify that your code does not override the root element's default font size. Manually setting a font size on the root element will prevent Dynamic Font Scaling from working as intended.
4. Verify that your code does not override font sizes on Ionic components. Ionic components that set `font-size` rules will use `rem` units. However, if your app overrides that to use `px`, then that custom rule will need to be converted to use `rem`. See [Integrating Custom Components](#integrating-custom-components) for more information.
5. Verify "Accessibility Page Zoom" is enabled if using Chrome for Android. See [Chrome for Android](#chrome-for-android) for more information.

### Maximum and minimum font sizes are not being respected on Android

The Android Web View scales any font sizes defined using the `px` unit by the system-level font scale preference. This means that actual font sizes may be larger or smaller than the font sizes defined in [min()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/min), [max()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/max), or [clamp()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/clamp).

See [how font scaling works on Android](#android) for more information.

### Font sizes are larger/smaller even with Dynamic Font Scaling disabled

Ionic components define font sizes using [rem units](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Values_and_units#lengths) even when Dynamic Font Scaling is disabled. This sizes the text in each component relative to the font size of the root element, which is usually the `html` element. As a result, if the font size of `html` changes, the computed font size of all Ionic components will change too.

### Scaled Ionic iOS component font sizes do not exactly match native iOS equivalents

Certain native iOS components such as the Action Sheet make use of private font scales that Ionic does not have access to. While we try to stay as close as possible to the native behavior, text in some components may render slightly larger or smaller than their native counterparts.

### The text size in my Ionic app on iOS changed when enabling Dynamic Font Scaling

The root element's default font size is typically `16px`. However, Dynamic Font Scaling on iOS devices make use of the ["Body" text style](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/typography#Specifications) which has a default font size of `17px`. Since the text in Ionic components is scaled relative to the root element's font size, some text may get larger or smaller when Dynamic Font Scaling is enabled, even if the system-level text scale did not change.

:::info
iOS provides a "Callout" text style which has a default font size of `16px`. However, this font style is currently not exposed to web content. See [the supported text styles in WebKit](https://webkit.org/blog/3709/using-the-system-font-in-web-content/) for more information.

  <title>Global Stylesheet: Styled CSS Component Options for Ionic Apps</title>
  <meta
    name="description"
    content="While Ionic component styles are self-contained, there are several global stylesheets and CSS options to include to utilize all features. Read to learn more."
  />
</head>

While Ionic Framework component styles are self-contained, there are several global stylesheets that should be included in order to use all of Ionic's features. Some of the stylesheets are required in order for an Ionic Framework app to look and behave properly, and others include optional utilities to quickly style your app.

## Available

### Required

The following CSS file must be included in order for Ionic Framework to work properly.

#### core.css

This file is the only stylesheet that is required in order for Ionic components to work properly. It includes app specific styles, and allows the `color` property to work across components. If this file is not included the colors will not show up and some elements may not appear properly.

### Recommended

The following CSS files are recommended to be included in an Ionic Framework app. If they are not included, some elements may have undesired styles. If Ionic Framework components are being used outside of an app, these files may not be necessary.

#### structure.css

Applies styles to `<html>` and defaults `box-sizing` to `border-box`. It ensures scrolling behaves like native in mobile devices.

#### typography.css

Typography changes the font-family of the entire document and modifies the font styles for heading elements. It also applies positioning styles to some native text elements. This file is necessary for [Dynamic Font Scaling](./dynamic-font-scaling) to work.

#### normalize.css

Makes browsers render all elements more consistently and in line with modern standards. It is based on [Normalize.css](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/).

### Optional

The following set of CSS files are optional and can safely be commented out or removed if the application is not using any of the features.

#### padding.css

Adds utility classes to modify the padding or margin on any element, see [CSS Utilities](css-utilities.md#content-space) for usage information.

#### float-elements.css

Adds utility classes to float an element based on the breakpoint and side, see [CSS Utilities](css-utilities.md#element-placement) for usage information.

#### text-alignment.css

Adds utility classes to align the text of an element or adjust the white space based on the breakpoint, see [CSS Utilities](css-utilities.md#text-alignment) for usage information.

#### text-transformation.css

Adds utility classes to transform the text of an element to `uppercase`, `lowercase` or `capitalize` based on the breakpoint, see [CSS Utilities](css-utilities.md#text-transformation) for usage information.

#### flex-utils.css

Adds utility classes to align flex containers and items, see [CSS Utilities](css-utilities.md#flex-properties) for usage information.

#### display.css

Adds utility classes to hide any element based on the breakpoint, see [CSS Utilities](css-utilities.md#element-display) for usage information.

## Usage

Refer to [Ionic Packages](../intro/cdn.md) for how to include the global stylesheets based on the framework and [CSS Utilities](css-utilities.md) for how to use the optional utilities.

  />
</head>

Ionic Framework provides several different layouts that can be used to structure an app. From single page layouts, to split pane views and modals.

## Header and Footer Layout

### Header

The most simple layout available consists of a [header](../api/header.md) and [content](../api/content.md). Most pages in an app generally have both of these, but a header is not required in order to use content.

import Header from '@site/static/usage/v8/header/basic/index.md';

<Header />

### Footer

While a toolbar in a header appears above the content, a footer appears below the content. A header and a footer can also be used together on the same page.

import Footer from '@site/static/usage/v8/footer/basic/index.md';

<Footer />

## Tabs Layout

A layout consisting of horizontal [tabs](../api/tabs.md) can be used to let the user quickly change between content views. Each tab can contain static content or a navigation stack by using a [router outlet](../api/router-outlet.md) or [nav](../api/nav.md).

import Tabs from '@site/static/usage/v8/tabs/router/index.md';

<Tabs />

## Menu Layout

A standard layout among mobile apps includes the ability to toggle a side [menu](../api/menu.md) by clicking a button or swiping it open from the side. Side menus are generally used for navigation, but they can contain any content.

import Menu from '@site/static/usage/v8/menu/basic/index.md';

<Menu />

## Split Pane Layout

A [split pane](../api/split-pane.md) layout has a more complex structure because it can combine the previous layouts. It allows for multiple views to be displayed when the viewport is above a specified breakpoint. If the device's screen size is below a certain size, the split pane view will be hidden.

By default, the split pane view will show when the screen is larger than `768px`, or the `md` breakpoint, but this can be customized to use different breakpoints by setting the `when` property. Below is an example where the split pane contains a menu that is visible for `xs` screens and up, or when the viewport is larger than `0px`. This will show the split pane for all screen sizes.

It's important to note that the element with the `id` matching the `contentId` specified by the split pane will be the main content that is always visible. This can be any element, including a [nav](../api/nav.md), [router outlet](../api/router-outlet.md), or [tabs](../api/tabs.md).

import SplitPane from '@site/static/usage/v8/split-pane/basic/index.md';

<SplitPane />

# Frequently Asked Question

## What is Capacitor?

Capacitor is a native runtime built by the Ionic team that offers web developers the ability to deploy their web apps to a native device. Capacitor is also exposing native device capabilities through JavaScript so developers can access features like native location services, filesystem access, or notifications as if they are interacting with any other JavaScript library.

## Permission Issues

If you're using a plugin, it may require adding additional permissions to your native project after you install the plugin. For instance, the Capacitor Camera plugin requires the following permission for iOS:

- `NSCameraUsageDescription` (`Privacy - Camera Usage Description`)
- `NSPhotoLibraryAddUsageDescription` (`Privacy - Photo Library Additions Usage Description`)
- `NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription` (`Privacy - Photo Library Usage Description`)

You need to manually add those permissions to the `info.plist` in your native project. Otherwise, calls to the native camera API will fail.

## Unexpected behavior

If for some reason the plugin does not behave in a way that is unexpected, please [open an issue on our github repo](https://github.com/ionic-team/capacitor-plugins)! Providing a clear issue report along with a reproduction can help get your issue resolved.

  `}</style>
</head>

Getting started with Capacitor is fairly straight forward for Ionic developers. Adding plugins to your project is no different than adding any dependencies you may need to a project.
<intro-end />

## Install

To install a plugin, find the plugin you want to use and install it using your package manager, like npm:

```shell
# Install the Capacitor Plugins
$ npm install @capacitor/camera
```

## Usage

Once installed, plugins can be imported into a component and you can call the native functionality directly from your code.

Using the [Camera plugin](native/camera.md) as an example, first install it:

Add native functionality to your app with Capacitor, a native runtime built by the Ionic team. Install the core packages and easily add them to your project. Capacitor has a wide range of capabilities that developers can use to access features like the device file system, camera, and native location services. All of this is powered by a unified TypeScript API that automatically handles platform differences.

While the core features of Capacitor are free and open source, some enterprises might find themselves needing more features or custom third-party integrations. If you need such additional features, check out the [Ionic Enterprise SDK](https://ionic.io/enterprise-sdk).

# Adding To An Existing React App

This post has been forked from [Ely Lucas' blog post](https://dev.to/ionic/adding-ionic-react-to-an-existing-react-project-4kib) and updated to the latest version of Ionic.

### Using Individual Ionic Components

Ionic React has around 100 components that you can begin using in your app immediately to help make it more mobile-friendly.

To get started with using components install the `@ionic/react` package:

```bash
npm i @ionic/react
```

Import the stylesheets from Ionic in your main app file:

```tsx title="App.tsx"
import '@ionic/react/css/core.css';
```

Add the `setupIonicReact` function to your app:

```tsx title="App.tsx"
import { setupIonicReact } from '@ionic/react';

setupIonicReact();

const App = () => {
  return (
    ...
  );
}

export default App;
```

:::note

`setupIonicReact` is a function that will set up the Ionic React components to work with your app. It is required to be called before using any of the Ionic React components.

:::

You can import any of the components and begin to use them right away. Here we are importing the `IonButton` and `IonDatetime` components and using them anywhere in our app:

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { IonButton, IonDatetime } from '@ionic/react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <>
      <IonDatetime></IonDatetime>
      <IonButton fill="clear">Start</IonButton>
    </>
  );
};
```

### Using Ionic Pages

If you want to convert part of your app and give it the whole Ionic experience, there are a few additional steps to take to get this setup.

First, import some additional CSS files that help set up the overall structure of the page and some utility helpers:

```js
/* Basic CSS for apps built with Ionic */
import '@ionic/react/css/normalize.css';
import '@ionic/react/css/structure.css';
import '@ionic/react/css/typography.css';

/* Optional CSS utils that can be commented out */
import '@ionic/react/css/padding.css';
import '@ionic/react/css/float-elements.css';
import '@ionic/react/css/text-alignment.css';
import '@ionic/react/css/text-transformation.css';
import '@ionic/react/css/flex-utils.css';
import '@ionic/react/css/display.css';
```

If you are using another CSS framework (like Bootstrap), you might want to isolate the Ionic pages away from them. This will help to ensure there aren't any CSS conflicts between the libraries.

Next, install the `@ionic/react-router` library:

```bash
npm i @ionic/react-router
```

The Ionic React Router library is a small wrapper around the popular React Router library and helps provide the functionality we need for native-like page transitions. The Ionic React Router library is compatible with v5 of React Router.

The main Ionic page will need a couple of base components. First, use a `IonApp` component (from `@ionic/react`) as the root component, and then use `IonReactRouter` (from `@ionic/react-router`).

`IonApp` sets up our main container, with the necessary styling needed for our structural components. `IonReactRouter` is a small wrapper for React Routers `BrowserRouter` and should be used in its place.

Then, wrap all your routes in an `IonRouterOutlet`, which is what manages our Ionic pages.

```tsx
import { IonApp, IonRouterOutlet } from '@ionic/react';
import { IonReactRouter } from '@ionic/react-router';

...

<IonApp>
  <IonReactRouter>
    <IonRouterOutlet>
      <Route path="/" exact component={Home} />
      <Route path="/about" exact component={About} />
    </IonRouterOutlet>
  </IonReactRouter>
</IonApp>
```

Now you can setup Ionic pages like so:

```tsx
<IonPage>
  <IonHeader>
    <IonToolbar>
      <IonTitle>My Page</IonTitle>
    </IonToolbar>
  </IonHeader>
  <IonContent>
    <IonDatetime></IonDatetime>
    <IonButton fill="clear">Start</IonButton>
  </IonContent>
</IonPage>
```

:::note

`IonPage` is important to have as the base component for your "Ionic" pages. `IonPage` is the element Ionic performs page transitions on.

:::

For more information on routing and navigation in Ionic React, see [here](/docs/react/navigation).

### Customize the Theme

To customize the look and feel of the components, Ionic has CSS variables you can [override](https://ionicframework.com/docs/theming/colors#modifying-colors) to provide a theme for your components. Set these in your main CSS file.

For more info on theming your Ionic app, see the guide [here](/docs/theming/themes).

### Wrapping up

Adding Ionic React to an existing React project is fairly simple and can be done in just a few minutes.

The great thing about using individual components from Ionic React is that you only import the component you need. This makes Ionic React ideal for adding it to existing projects that need to look and work great on mobile devices.

    content="The React Lifecycle guide discusses how to use the Ionic Lifecycle events in an Ionic React application. Read to learn more about React component lifecycles."
  />
</head>

This guide discusses how to use the Ionic Lifecycle events in an Ionic React application.

## Ionic Lifecycle Methods

Ionic provides a few lifecycle methods that you can use in your apps:

| Event Name         | Description                                                        |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `ionViewWillEnter` | Fired when the component routing to is about to animate into view. |
| `ionViewDidEnter`  | Fired when the component routing to has _finished_ animating.      |
| `ionViewWillLeave` | Fired when the component routing _from_ is about to animate.       |
| `ionViewDidLeave`  | Fired when the component routing _from_ has _finished_ animating.  |

These lifecycles are only called on components directly mapped by a router. This means if `/pageOne` maps to `PageOneComponent`, then Ionic lifecycles will be called on `PageOneComponent` but will not be called on any child components that `PageOneComponent` may render.

The way you access these methods varies based on if you are using class-based components or functional components. We cover both methods below.

## Lifecycle Methods in Class-Based Components

to use the Ionic Lifecycle methods in a class-based component, you must wrap your component with the `withIonLifeCycle` higher order component (HOC) like so:

```tsx
export default withIonLifeCycle(HomePage);
```

:::note
`withIonLifeCycle` is imported from `@ionic/react`
:::

You can then create the appropriate lifecycle method on your class component, and the HOC calls that method when the event happens. Below is the entire component with each of the lifecycle methods implemented:

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { IonHeader, IonPage, IonToolbar, IonTitle, IonContent, withIonLifeCycle } from '@ionic/react';

class HomePage extends React.Component {
  ionViewWillEnter() {
    console.log('ionViewWillEnter event fired');
  }

  ionViewWillLeave() {
    console.log('ionViewWillLeave event fired');
  }

  ionViewDidEnter() {
    console.log('ionViewDidEnter event fired');
  }

  ionViewDidLeave() {
    console.log('ionViewDidLeave event fired');
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <IonPage>
        <IonHeader>
          <IonToolbar>
            <IonTitle>Home</IonTitle>
          </IonToolbar>
        </IonHeader>
        <IonContent></IonContent>
      </IonPage>
    );
  }
}

export default withIonLifeCycle(HomePage);
```

## Lifecycle Methods in Functional Components

Ionic React exports hooks for each of the lifecycle methods that you can use in your functional components. Each of the hooks takes the method you want called when the event fires.

```tsx
import {
  IonContent,
  IonHeader,
  IonTitle,
  IonToolbar,
  useIonViewDidEnter,
  useIonViewDidLeave,
  useIonViewWillEnter,
  useIonViewWillLeave,
} from '@ionic/react';
import React from 'react';

const HomePage: React.FC = () => {
  useIonViewDidEnter(() => {
    console.log('ionViewDidEnter event fired');
  });

  useIonViewDidLeave(() => {
    console.log('ionViewDidLeave event fired');
  });

  useIonViewWillEnter(() => {
    console.log('ionViewWillEnter event fired');
  });

  useIonViewWillLeave(() => {
    console.log('ionViewWillLeave event fired');
  });

  return (
    <IonPage>
      <IonHeader>
        <IonToolbar>
          <IonTitle>Home</IonTitle>
        </IonToolbar>
      </IonHeader>
      <IonContent></IonContent>
    </IonPage>
  );
};

export default HomePage;
```

:::note
Functional components don't need to be wrapped with the `withIonLifeCycle` HOC as class components do.
:::

Developers can also optionally pass reactive dependencies to each lifecycle hook. These are then passed to the underlying [React useEffect hook](https://react.dev/reference/react/useEffect#useeffect):

```tsx
const [data, setData] = useState('foo');

useIonViewDidEnter(() => {
  console.log('ionViewDidEnter event fired');
}, [data]);
```

## React LifeCycle Methods

All the lifecycle methods in React (`componentDidMount`, `componentWillUnmount`, etc..) are available for you to use as well. However, since Ionic React manages the lifetime of a page, certain events might not fire when you expect them to. For instance, `componentDidMount` fires the first time a page is displayed, but if you navigate away from the page Ionic might keep the page around in the DOM, and a subsequent visit to the page might not call `componentDidMount` again. This scenario is the main reason the Ionic lifecycle methods exist, to still give you a way to call logic when views enter and exit when the native framework's events might not fire.

## Guidance for Each LifeCycle Method

Below are some tips on use cases for each of the life cycle events.

- `ionViewWillEnter` - Since `ionViewWillEnter` is called every time the view is navigated to (regardless if initialized or not), it's a good method to load data from services.
- `ionViewDidEnter` - If you see performance problems from using `ionViewWillEnter` when loading data, you can do your data calls in `ionViewDidEnter` instead. This event won't fire until after the page is visible to the user, however, so you might want to use either a loading indicator or a skeleton screen, so content doesn't flash in un-naturally after the transition is complete.
- `ionViewWillLeave` - Can be used for cleanup, like unsubscribing from data sources. Since `componentWillUnmount` might not fire when you navigate from the current page, put your cleanup code here if you don't want it active while the screen is not in view.
- `ionViewDidLeave` - When this event fires, you know the new page has fully transitioned in, so any logic you might not normally do when the view is visible can go here.

## Passing state between pages

Since Ionic React manages the lifetime of a page, state on previous pages may update as users navigate your application. This can impact state that is determined using `useEffect` from React or `useLocation` from React Router. For example, if `PageA` calls `useLocation`, the state of `useLocation` will change when the user navigates from `PageA` to `PageB`.

Developers should include the appropriate checks to ensure that previous pages only access defined states.

For example, the following code will error if `testObject` is not defined: `{ state.testObject.childKey }`

Instead, developers should access `childKey` only if `testObject` is defined: `{ state.testObject?.childKey }`

This guide covers how routing works in an app built with Ionic and React.

`IonReactRouter` uses the popular [React Router](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router) library under the hood. With Ionic and React Router, you can create multi-page apps with rich page transitions.

Everything you know about routing using React Router carries over into Ionic React. Let's take a look at the basics of an Ionic React app and how routing works with it.

## Routing in Ionic React

Here is a sample `App` component that defines a single route to the "/dashboard" URL. When you visit "/dashboard", the route renders the `DashboardPage` component.

**App.tsx**

```tsx
const App: React.FC = () => (
  <IonApp>
    <IonReactRouter>
      <IonRouterOutlet>
        <Route path="/dashboard" component={DashboardPage} />
        <Redirect exact from="/" to="/dashboard" />
      </IonRouterOutlet>
    </IonReactRouter>
  </IonApp>
);
```

Directly after the `Route`, we define our default `Redirect`, which, when a user visits the root URL of the app ("/"), it redirects them to the "/dashboard" URL.

The redirect also has the `exact` prop set, which means the URL has to match the `from` prop (or the `path` prop if `exact` was used on a `Route`) precisely for this route to be a match. Without it, this redirect would render for every route, since every route begins with "/".

You can also programmatically redirect from a Route's render method based on a condition, like checking if a user is authed or not:

```tsx
<Route
  exact
  path="/dashboard"
  render={(props) => {
    return isAuthed ? <DashboardPage {...props} /> : <LoginPage />;
  }}
/>
```

## IonReactRouter

The `IonReactRouter` component wraps the traditional [`BrowserRouter`](https://v5.reactrouter.com/web/api/BrowserRouter) component from React Router, and sets the app up for routing. Therefore, use `IonReactRouter` in place of `BrowserRouter`. You can pass in any props to `IonReactRouter` and they will be passed down to the underlying `BrowserRouter`.

## Nested Routes

Inside the Dashboard page, we define more routes related to this specific section of the app:

**DashboardPage.tsx**

```tsx
const DashboardPage: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <IonPage>
      <IonRouterOutlet>
        <Route exact path="/dashboard" component={UsersListPage} />
        <Route path="/dashboard/users/:id" component={UserDetailPage} />
      </IonRouterOutlet>
    </IonPage>
  );
};
```

Here, there are a couple more routes defined to point to pages from within the dashboard portion of the app. Note, that we need to define the whole route in the path, and we can't leave off "/dashboard" even though we arrived to this page from that URL. React Router requires full paths, and relative paths are not supported.

However, we can use the [`match`](https://v5.reactrouter.com/web/api/match) objects `url` property to provide the URL that was matched to render a component, which helps when working with nested routes:

```tsx
const DashboardPage: React.FC<RouteComponentProps> = ({ match }) => {
  return (
    <IonPage>
      <IonRouterOutlet>
        <Route exact path={match.url} component={UsersListPage} />
        <Route path={`${match.url}/users/:id`} component={UserDetailPage} />
      </IonRouterOutlet>
    </IonPage>
  );
};
```

Here, `match.url` contains the value of "/dashboard", since that was the URL used to render the `DashboardPage`.

These routes are grouped in an `IonRouterOutlet`, let's discuss that next.

## IonRouterOutlet

The `IonRouterOutlet` component provides a container for Routes that render Ionic "pages". When a page is in an `IonRouterOutlet`, the container controls the transition animation between the pages as well as controls when a page is created and destroyed, which helps maintain the state between the views when switching back and forth between them.

The `DashboardPage` above shows a users list page and a details page. When navigating between the two pages, the `IonRouterOutlet` provides the appropriate platform page transition and keeps the state of the previous page intact so that when a user navigates back to the list page, it appears in the same state as when it left.

An `IonRouterOutlet` should only contain `Route`s or `Redirect`s. Any other component should be rendered either as a result of a `Route` or outside of the `IonRouterOutlet`.

## Fallback Route

A common routing use case is to provide a "fallback" route to be rendered in the event the location navigated to does not match any of the routes defined.

We can define a fallback route by placing a `Route` component without a `path` property as the last route defined within an `IonRouterOutlet`.

**DashboardPage.tsx**

```tsx
const DashboardPage: React.FC<RouteComponentProps> = ({ match }) => {
  return (
    <IonRouterOutlet>
      <Route exact path={match.url} component={UsersListPage} />
      <Route path={`${match.url}/users/:id`} component={UserDetailPage} />
      <Route render={() => <Redirect to={match.url} />} />
    </IonRouterOutlet>
  );
};
```

Here, we see that in the event a location does not match the first two `Route`s the `IonRouterOutlet` will redirect the Ionic React app to the `match.url` path.

You can alternatively supply a component to render instead of providing a redirect.

```tsx
const DashboardPage: React.FC<RouteComponentProps> = ({ match }) => {
  return (
    <IonRouterOutlet>
      <Route exact path={match.url} component={UsersListPage} />
      <Route path={`${match.url}/users/:id`} component={UserDetailPage} />
      <Route component={NotFoundPage} />
    </IonRouterOutlet>
  );
};
```

## IonPage

The `IonPage` component wraps each view in an Ionic React app and allows page transitions and stack navigation to work properly. Each view that is navigated to using the router must include an `IonPage` component.

```tsx
import { IonContent, IonHeader, IonPage, IonTitle, IonToolbar } from '@ionic/react';
import React from 'react';

const Home: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <IonPage>
      <IonHeader>
        <IonToolbar>
          <IonTitle>Home</IonTitle>
        </IonToolbar>
      </IonHeader>
      <IonContent className="ion-padding">Hello World</IonContent>
    </IonPage>
  );
};
export default Home;
```

## Navigation

There are several options available when routing to different views in an Ionic React app. Here, the `UsersListPage` uses `IonItem`'s `routerLink` prop to specify the route to go to when the item is tapped/clicked:

**UsersListPage.tsx**

```tsx
const UsersListPage: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <IonPage>
      <IonHeader>
        <IonToolbar>
          <IonTitle>Users</IonTitle>
        </IonToolbar>
      </IonHeader>
      <IonContent>
        <IonList>
          <IonItem routerLink="/dashboard/users/1">
            <IonLabel>User 1</IonLabel>
          </IonItem>
          <IonItem routerLink="/dashboard/users/2">
            <IonLabel>User 2</IonLabel>
          </IonItem>
        </IonList>
      </IonContent>
    </IonPage>
  );
};
```

Other components that have the `routerLink` prop are `IonButton`, `IonCard`, `IonRouterLink`, `IonFabButton`, and `IonItemOption`.

Each of these components also have a `routerDirection` prop to explicitly set the type of page transition to use (`"forward"`, `"back"`, or `"root"`).

Outside of these components that have the `routerLink` prop, you can also use React Routers [`Link`](https://v5.reactrouter.com/web/api/Link) component to navigate between views:

```html
<Link to="/dashboard/users/1">User 1</Link>
```

We recommend using one of the above methods whenever possible for routing. The advantage to these approaches is that they both render an anchor (`<a>`)tag, which is suitable for overall app accessibility.

A programmatic option for navigation is using the [`history`](https://v5.reactrouter.com/web/api/history) prop that React Router provides to the components it renders via routes.

```tsx
<IonButton
  onClick={(e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    history.push('/dashboard/users/1');
  }}
>
  Go to User 1
</IonButton>
```

:::note
`history` is a prop.
:::

### Navigating using `history.go`

React Router uses the `history` package which has a [history.go](https://github.com/remix-run/history/blob/dev/docs/api-reference.md#history.go) method that allows developers to move forward or backward through the application history. Let's take a look at an example.

Say you have the following application history:

`/pageA` --> `/pageB` --> `/pageC`

If you were to call `router.go(-2)` on `/pageC`, you would be brought back to `/pageA`. If you then called `router.go(2)`, you would be brought to `/pageC`.

Using `history.go()` in Ionic React is not supported at the moment. Interested in seeing support for this get added to Ionic React? [Let us know on GitHub](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-framework/issues/23775)!

## URL Parameters

The second route defined in the Dashboard Page has a URL parameter defined (the ":id" portion in the path). URL parameters are dynamic portions of the `path`, and when the user navigates to a URL such as "/dashboard/users/1", the "1" is saved to a parameter named "id", which can be accessed in the component the route renders. Let's see how that's done.

**UserDetailPage.tsx**

```tsx
interface UserDetailPageProps
  extends RouteComponentProps<{
    id: string;
  }> {}

const UserDetailPage: React.FC<UserDetailPageProps> = ({ match }) => {
  return (
    <IonPage>
      <IonHeader>
        <IonToolbar>
          <IonTitle>User Detail</IonTitle>
        </IonToolbar>
      </IonHeader>
      <IonContent>User {match.params.id}</IonContent>
    </IonPage>
  );
};
```

The [`match`](https://v5.reactrouter.com/web/api/match) prop contains information about the matched route, including the URL params. We obtain the `id` param here and display it on the screen.

Note how we use a TypeScript interface to strongly type the props object. The interface gives us type safety and code completion inside of the component.

## Linear Routing versus Non-Linear Routing

### Linear Routing

If you have built a web app that uses routing, you likely have used linear routing before. Linear routing means that you can move forward or backward through the application history by pushing and popping pages.

The following is an example of linear routing in a mobile app:

<video
  style={{
    margin: '40px auto',
    display: 'flex',
  }}
  width="400"
  src={useBaseUrl('video/linear-routing-demo.mp4')}
  controls
></video>

The application history in this example has the following path:

`Accessibility` --> `VoiceOver` --> `Speech`

When we press the back button, we follow that same routing path except in reverse. Linear routing is helpful in that it allows for simple and predictable routing behaviors.

The downside of linear routing is that it does not allow for complex user experiences such as tab views. This is where non-linear routing comes into play.

### Non-Linear Routing

Non-linear routing is a concept that may be new to many web developers learning to build mobile apps with Ionic.

Non-linear routing means that the view that the user should go back to is not necessarily the previous view that was displayed on the screen.

The following is an example of non-linear routing:

<video
  style={{
    margin: '40px auto',
    display: 'flex',
  }}
  width="400"
  src={useBaseUrl('video/non-linear-routing-demo.mp4')}
  controls
></video>

In the example above, we start on the `Originals` tab. Tapping a card brings us to the `Ted Lasso` view within the `Originals` tab.

From here, we switch to the `Search` tab. Then, we tap the `Originals` tab again and are brought back to the `Ted Lasso` view. At this point, we have started using non-linear routing.

Why is this non-linear routing? The previous view we were on was the `Search` view. However, pressing the back button on the `Ted Lasso` view should bring us back to the root `Originals` view. This happens because each tab in a mobile app is treated as its own stack. The [Working with Tabs](#working-with-tabs) sections goes over this in more detail.

If tapping the back button simply called `history.go(-1)` from the `Ted Lasso` view, we would be brought back to the `Search` view which is not correct.

Non-linear routing allows for sophisticated user flows that linear routing cannot handle. However, certain linear routing APIs such as `history.go()` cannot be used in this non-linear environment. This means that `history.go()` should not be used when using tabs or nested outlets.

### Which one should I choose?

We recommend keeping your application as simple as possible until you need to add non-linear routing. Non-linear routing is very powerful, but it also adds a considerable amount of complexity to mobile applications.

The two most common uses of non-linear routing is with tabs and nested `IonRouterOutlets`. We recommend only using non-linear routing if your application meets the tabs or nested router outlet use cases.

For more on tabs, please see [Working with Tabs](#working-with-tabs).

For more on nested router outlets, please see [Nested Routes](#nested-routes).

## Shared URLs versus Nested Routes

A common point of confusion when setting up routing is deciding between shared URLs or nested routes. This part of the guide will explain both and help you decide which one to use.

### Shared URLs

Shared URLs is a route configuration where routes have pieces of the URL in common. The following is an example of a shared URL configuration:

```tsx
const App: React.FC = () => (
  <IonApp>
    <IonReactRouter>
      <IonRouterOutlet>
        <Route path="/dashboard" exact={true}>
          <DashboardMainPage />
        </Route>
        <Route path="/dashboard/stats" exact={true}>
          <DashboardStatsPage />
        </Route>
      </IonRouterOutlet>
    </IonReactRouter>
  </IonApp>
);
```

The above routes are considered "shared" because they reuse the `dashboard` piece of the URL.

### Nested Routes

Nested Routes is a route configuration where routes are listed as children of other routes. The following is an example of a nested route configuration:

```tsx
const App: React.FC = () => (
  <IonApp>
    <IonReactRouter>
      <IonRouterOutlet>
        <Route path="/dashboard/:id">
          <DashboardRouterOutlet />
        </Route>
      </IonRouterOutlet>
    </IonReactRouter>
  </IonApp>
);

const DashboardRouterOutlet: React.FC = () => (
  <IonRouterOutlet>
    <Route path="/dashboard" exact={true}>
      <DashboardMainPage />
    </Route>
    <Route path="/dashboard/stats" exact={true}>
      <DashboardStatsPage />
    </Route>
  </IonRouterOutlet>
);
```

The above routes are nested because they are in the `children` array of the parent route. Notice that the parent route renders the `DashboardRouterOutlet` component. When you nest routes, you need to render another instance of `IonRouterOutlet`.

### Which one should I choose?

Shared URLs are great when you want to transition from page A to page B while preserving the relationship between the two pages in the URL. In our previous example, a button on the `/dashboard` page could transition to the `/dashboard/stats` page. The relationship between the two pages is preserved because of a) the page transition and b) the url.

Nested routes should be used when you want to render content in outlet A while also rendering sub-content inside of a nested outlet B. The most common use case you will run into is tabs. When you load up a tabs Ionic starter application, you will see `IonTabBar` and `IonTabs` components rendered in the first `IonRouterOutlet`. The `IonTabs` component renders another `IonRouterOutlet` which is responsible for rendering the contents of each tab.

There are very few use cases in which nested routes make sense in mobile applications. When in doubt, use the shared URL route configuration. We strongly caution against using nested routing in contexts other than tabs as it can quickly make navigating your app confusing.

## Working with Tabs

When working with tabs, Ionic needs a way to know which view belongs to which tab. The `IonTabs` component comes in handy here, but let's look at what the routing setup for this looks like:

```tsx
<IonApp>
  <IonReactRouter>
    <IonRouterOutlet>
      <Route path="/tabs" render={() => <Tabs />} />
      <Route exact path="/">
        <Redirect to="/tabs" />
      </Route>
    </IonRouterOutlet>
  </IonReactRouter>
</IonApp>
```

Here, our `tabs` path loads a `Tabs` component. We provide each tab as a route object inside of this component. In this example, we call the path `tabs`, but this can be customized.

Let's start by taking a look at our `Tabs` component:

```tsx
import { Redirect, Route } from 'react-router-dom';
import { IonIcon, IonLabel, IonRouterOutlet, IonTabBar, IonTabButton, IonTabs } from '@ionic/react';
import { IonReactRouter } from '@ionic/react-router';
import { ellipse, square, triangle } from 'ionicons/icons';
import Tab1 from './pages/Tab1';
import Tab2 from './pages/Tab2';
import Tab3 from './pages/Tab3';

const Tabs: React.FC = () => (
  <IonTabs>
    <IonRouterOutlet>
      <Redirect exact path="/tabs" to="/tabs/tab1" />
      <Route exact path="/tabs/tab1">
        <Tab1 />
      </Route>
      <Route exact path="/tabs/tab2">
        <Tab2 />
      </Route>
      <Route path="/tabs/tab3">
        <Tab3 />
      </Route>
      <Route exact path="/tabs">
        <Redirect to="/tabs/tab1" />
      </Route>
    </IonRouterOutlet>
    <IonTabBar slot="bottom">
      <IonTabButton tab="tab1" href="/tabs/tab1">
        <IonIcon icon={triangle} />
        <IonLabel>Tab 1</IonLabel>
      </IonTabButton>
      <IonTabButton tab="tab2" href="/tabs/tab2">
        <IonIcon icon={ellipse} />
        <IonLabel>Tab 2</IonLabel>
      </IonTabButton>
      <IonTabButton tab="tab3" href="/tabs/tab3">
        <IonIcon icon={square} />
        <IonLabel>Tab 3</IonLabel>
      </IonTabButton>
    </IonTabBar>
  </IonTabs>
);

export default Tabs;
```

If you have worked with Ionic Framework before, this should feel familiar. We create an `IonTabs` component and provide an `IonTabBar`. The `IonTabBar` provides `IonTabButton` components, each with a `tab` property that is associated with its corresponding tab in the router config. We also provide an `IonRouterOutlet` to give `IonTabs` an outlet to render the different tab views in.

:::tip
`IonTabs` renders an `IonPage` for you, so you do not need to add `IonPage` manually here.
:::

### How Tabs in Ionic Work

Each tab in Ionic is treated as an individual navigation stack. This means if you have three tabs in your application, each tab has its own navigation stack. Within each stack you can navigate forwards (push a view) and backwards (pop a view).

This behavior is important to note as it is different than most tab implementations that are found in other web based UI libraries. Other libraries typically manage tabs as one single history stack.

Since Ionic is focused on helping developers build mobile apps, the tabs in Ionic are designed to match native mobile tabs as closely as possible. As a result, there may be certain behaviors in Ionic's tabs that differ from tabs implementations you have seen in other UI libraries. Read on to learn more about some of these differences.

### Child Routes within Tabs

When adding additional routes to tabs you should write them as sibling routes with the parent tab as the path prefix. The example below defines the `/tabs/tab1/view` route as a sibling of the `/tabs/tab1` route. Since this new route has the `tab1` prefix, it will be rendered inside of the `Tabs` component, and Tab 1 will still be selected in the `IonTabBar`.

```tsx
<IonTabs>
  <IonRouterOutlet>
    <Redirect exact path="/tabs" to="/tabs/tab1" />
    <Route exact path="/tabs/tab1">
      <Tab1 />
    </Route>
    <Route exact path="/tabs/tab1/view">
      <Tab1View />
    </Route>
    <Route exact path="/tabs/tab2">
      <Tab2 />
    </Route>
    <Route path="/tabs/tab3">
      <Tab3 />
    </Route>
    <Route exact path="/tabs">
      <Redirect to="/tabs/tab1" />
    </Route>
  </IonRouterOutlet>
  <IonTabBar slot="bottom">
    <IonTabButton tab="tab1" href="/tabs/tab1">
      <IonIcon icon={triangle} />
      <IonLabel>Tab 1</IonLabel>
    </IonTabButton>
    <IonTabButton tab="tab2" href="/tabs/tab2">
      <IonIcon icon={ellipse} />
      <IonLabel>Tab 2</IonLabel>
    </IonTabButton>
    <IonTabButton tab="tab3" href="/tabs/tab3">
      <IonIcon icon={square} />
      <IonLabel>Tab 3</IonLabel>
    </IonTabButton>
  </IonTabBar>
</IonTabs>
```

### Switching Between Tabs

Since each tab is its own navigation stack, it is important to note that these navigation stacks should never interact. This means that there should never be a button in Tab 1 that routes a user to Tab 2. In other words, tabs should only be changed by the user tapping a tab button in the tab bar.

A good example of this in practice is the iOS App Store and Google Play Store mobile applications. These apps both provide tabbed interfaces, but neither one ever routes the user across tabs. For example, the "Games" tab in the iOS App Store app never directs users to the "Search" tab and vice versa.

Let's take a look at a couple common mistakes that are made with tabs.

**A Settings Tab That Multiple Tabs Reference**

A common practice is to create a Settings view as its own tab. This is great if developers need to present several nested settings menus. However, other tabs should never try to route to the Settings tab. As we mentioned above, the only way that the Settings tab should be activated is by a user tapping the appropriate tab button.

If you find that your tabs need to reference the Settings tab, we recommend making the Settings view a modal by using `ion-modal`. This is a practice found in the iOS App Store app. With this approach, any tab can present the modal without breaking the mobile tabs pattern of each tab being its own stack.

The example below shows how the iOS App Store app handles presenting an "Account" view from multiple tabs. By presenting the "Account" view in a modal, the app can work within the mobile tabs best practices to show the same view across multiple tabs.

<video
  style={{
    margin: '40px auto',
    display: 'flex',
  }}
  width="400"
  src={useBaseUrl('video/tabs-account-demo.mp4')}
  controls
></video>

**Reusing Views Across Tabs**

Another common practice is to present the same view in multiple tabs. Developers often try to do this by having the view contained in a single tab, with other tabs routing to that tab. As we mentioned above, this breaks the mobile tabs pattern and should be avoided.

Instead, we recommend having routes in each tab that reference the same component. This is a practice done in popular apps like Spotify. For example, you can access an album or podcast from the "Home", "Search", and "Your Library" tabs. When accessing the album or podcast, users stay within that tab. The app does this by creating routes per tab and sharing a common component in the codebase.

The example below shows how the Spotify app reuses the same album component to show content in multiple tabs. Notice that each screenshot shows the same album but from a different tab.

|                      Home Tab                       |                      Search Tab                       |

## Live Example

### IonRouterOutlet in a Tabs View

When working in a tabs view, Ionic React needs a way to determine what views belong to which tabs. We accomplish this by taking advantage of the fact that the paths provided to a `Route` are regular expressions.

While the syntax looks a bit strange, it is reasonably straightforward once you understand it.

For example, the routes for a view with two tabs (sessions and speakers) can be set up as such:

```tsx
<IonRouterOutlet>
  <Route path="/:tab(sessions)" component={SessionsPage} exact={true} />
  <Route path="/:tab(sessions)/:id" component={SessionDetail} />
  <Route path="/:tab(speakers)" component={SpeakerList} exact={true} />
</IonRouterOutlet>
```

If the navigated URL were "/sessions", it would match the first route and add a URL parameter named "tab" with the value of "sessions" to the resulting `match` object passed into `SessionsPage`.

When a user navigates to a session detail page ("/sessions/1" for instance), the second route adds a URL parameter named "tab" with a value of "sessions". When `IonRouterOutlet` sees that both pages are in the same "sessions" tab, it provides an animated page transition to the new view. If a user navigates to a new tab ("speakers" in this case), `IonRouterOutlet` knows not to provide the animation.

### Switches in IonRouterOutlet

Since `IonRouterOutlet` takes over the job in determining which routes get rendered, using a `Switch` from React Router has no effect when used inside of an `IonRouterOutlet`. Switches still function as expected when used outside an `IonRouterOutlet`.

## Utilities

### useIonRouter

The `useIonRouter` hook can be used for more direct control over routing in Ionic React. It allows you to pass additional metadata to Ionic, such as a custom animation, before calling React Router.

The `useIonRouter` hook returns a `UseIonRouterResult` which has several convenience methods for routing:

```typescript
type UseIonRouterResult = {
  /**
   * Navigates to a new pathname
   * @param pathname - The path to navigate to
   * @param routerDirection - Optional - The RouterDirection to use for transition purposes, defaults to 'forward'
   * @param routeAction - Optional - The RouteAction to use for history purposes, defaults to 'push'
   * @param routerOptions - Optional - Any additional parameters to pass to the router
   * @param animationBuilder - Optional - A custom transition animation to use
   */
  push(
    pathname: string,
    routerDirection?: RouterDirection,
    routeAction?: RouteAction,
    routerOptions?: RouterOptions,
    animationBuilder?: AnimationBuilder
  ): void;
  /**
   * Navigates backwards in history, using the IonRouter to determine history
   * @param animationBuilder - Optional - A custom transition animation to use
   */
  goBack(animationBuilder?: AnimationBuilder): void;
  /**
   * Determines if there are any additional routes in the the Router's history. However, routing is not prevented if the browser's history has more entries. Returns true if more entries exist, false if not.
   */
  canGoBack(): boolean;
  /**
   * Information about the current route.
   */
  routeInfo: RouteInfo;
};
```

The following example shows how to use `useIonRouter`:

```tsx
import { useIonRouter } from '@ionic/react';

const MyComponent: React.FC = () => {
  const router = useIonRouter();
  const goToPage = () => {
    router.push('/my-page', 'root', 'replace');
  };

  ...
}

```

# Using Overlay Components in React

For Ionic React, there are two techniques you can use to display overlay components like modals, alerts, action sheets, etc. In this guide, we will go over both of them.

## Overlay Hooks

Starting in Ionic React 5.6, we introduced new React hooks you can use to control displaying and dismissing overlays. These hooks provide a programmatic way of controlling the overlays, as well as a way to use overlays outside of your Ionic Page without the need of a state management system.

To use one of the overlay hooks, you import the hook for the overlay you want to use from `@ionic/react`. For example, if we want to use the Alert overlay, we import `useIonAlert`:

```tsx
import { useIonAlert } from '@ionic/react';
```

The hooks return an array, where the first item in the array is the method to present the hook, and the second is the method to dismiss the hook:

```tsx
const [showAlert, hideAlert] = useIonAlert();
```

:::note
Overlays often dismiss themselves when the user is done interacting with them, so you might not need to use dismiss/hide method.
:::

To display the overlay, you use the present method, which we destructured to the name `showAlert`. The method takes in a set of parameters that vary depending on each overlay, but generally, they can either take in a simple set of common parameters or an object to specify additional options.

```tsx
showAlert('Hello!', [{ text: 'Ok' }]);
```

For `useIonAlert`, the first parameter is the message to display, and the second is an array of `AlertButtons` to customize the buttons the alert will show.

Alternatively, you can pass in an AlertOptions config object to provide additional parameters, such as a CSS class to add to the markup, a header for the alert, and a callback that gets called when the alert is dismissed:

```tsx
showAlert({
  cssClass: 'my-css',
  header: 'Alert',
  message: 'Hello!',
  buttons: ['Cancel', { text: 'Ok', handler: (d) => console.log('ok pressed') }],
  onDidDismiss: (e) => console.log('alert dismiss'),
});
```

Overlay hooks that display additional custom components as part of their markup, such as [modals](https://ionicframework.com/docs/api/modal) and [popovers](https://ionicframework.com/docs/api/popover), take in a couple of additional parameters when initializing their hooks. The first parameter is the component you want your overlay to display, and the second is an object of additional props you want to pass into the component when it gets constructed:

```tsx
const [present, dismiss] = useIonModal(({ name }) => <div>Hello {name}.</div>, {
  name: 'Dave',
});
```

## Overlay Components

Overlays can also be displayed by using components from `@ionic/react`. The components take a `isOpen` prop that you provide to control if the overlay is currently being displayed or not. When `isOpen` switches from true to false (and vise versa), Ionic will open/close the overlay with the appropriate animation. You can also supply any other additional config options as props to the overlay:

```tsx
<IonAlert isOpen={showAlert} message="Hello!" buttons={[{ text: 'Ok' }]} onDidDismiss={() => setShowAlert(false)} />
```

Above, the `showAlert` boolean is a piece of state provided from your application.

When the overlay is dismissed, it is important to tie into the `onDidDismiss` callback and set your state variable to indicate that the overlay is no longer presenting. Ionic React looks for changes to the `isOpen` prop to determine if the overlay should be displayed or not.

For overlays that display custom components, such as [modals](https://ionicframework.com/docs/api/modal) and [popovers](https://ionicframework.com/docs/api/popover), you provide the component as a child to the overlay component:

```tsx
<IonModal isOpen={showModal}>
  <div>Hello!</div>
</IonModal>
```

:::note
The Overlay Components are still a valid way of displaying overlays and are in no way a deprecated method. Use whichever method best fits your application.

`@ionic/react` brings the full power of the Ionic Framework to React developers. It offers seamless integration with the React ecosystem, so you can build high-quality cross-platform apps using familiar React tools, components, and best practices. You also get access to Ionic's extensive UI library and native capabilities.

## React Version Support

Ionic React supports the latest versions of React. For detailed information on supported versions and our support policy, see the [Ionic React Support Policy](/docs/reference/support#ionic-react).

## React Tooling

Ionic React works seamlessly with the React CLI and popular React tooling. You can use your favorite libraries for state management, testing, and more. Ionic React is designed to fit naturally into the React ecosystem, so you can use tools like Create React App, Vite, or Next.js to scaffold and build your apps.

## Native Tooling

[Capacitor](https://capacitorjs.com) is the official cross-platform runtime for Ionic Angular, enabling your apps to run natively on iOS, Android, and the web with a single codebase.

## Installation

```shell-session
$ npm install -g @ionic/cli
$ ionic start myApp tabs --type react

$ cd myApp
$ ionic serve █
```

  <title>React Performance Testing - Using Loops with Ionic App Components</title>
  <meta
    name="description"
    content="React performance testing for Ionic apps. When using loops with Ionic components, we recommend using React's key attribute. Read to learn more."
  />
</head>

## Loops with Ionic Components

When using loops with Ionic components, we recommend using React's `key` attribute. This allows React to re-render loop elements in an efficient way by only updating the content inside of the component rather than re-creating the component altogether.

By using `key` you can provide a stable identity for each loop element so React can track insertions and deletions within the iterator. Below is an example of how to use `key`:

**MyComponent.tsx**

```tsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { IonContent, IonItem, IonLabel, IonPage } from '@ionic/react';

export const MyComponent: React.FC = () => {
  const [items, setItems] = useState([{ id: 0, value: 'Item 0' }, { id: 1, value: 'Item 1' }, ...]);

  return (
    <IonPage>
      <IonContent>
        {items.map(item => {
          return (
            <IonItem key={item.id}>
              <IonLabel>{item.value}</IonLabel>
            </IonItem>
          )
        })}
      </IonContent>
    </IonPage>
  )
}
```

In this example, we have an array of objects called `items`. Each object contains a `value` and an `id`. Using the `key` attribute, we pass the `item.id` for each object. This `id` is used to provide a stable identity for each loop element.

For more information on how React renders lists using `key` see: https://react.dev/learn/rendering-lists#keeping-list-items-in-order-with-key

-------- ./react/platform.md --------
# Platform

## isPlatform

The `isPlatform` method can be used to test if your app is running on a certain platform:

```tsx
import { isPlatform } from '@ionic/react';

isPlatform('ios'); // returns true when running on a iOS device
```

Depending on the platform the user is on, isPlatform(platformName) will return true or false. Note that the same app can return true for more than one platform name. For example, an app running from an iPad would return true for the platform names: mobile, ios, ipad, and tablet. Additionally, if the app was running from Cordova then cordova would be true.

## getPlatforms

The `getPlatforms` method can be used to determine which platforms your app is currently running on.

```tsx
import { getPlatforms } from '@ionic/react';

getPlatforms(); // returns ["iphone", "ios", "mobile", "mobileweb"] from an iPhone
```

Depending on what device you are on, `getPlatforms` can return multiple values. Each possible value is a hierarchy of platforms. For example, on an iPhone, it would return mobile, ios, and iphone.

## Platforms

Below is a table listing all the possible platform values along with corresponding descriptions.

| Platform Name | Description                              |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| android       | a device running Android                 |
| capacitor     | a device running Capacitor               |
| cordova       | a device running Cordova                 |
| desktop       | a desktop device                         |
| electron      | a desktop device running Electron        |
| hybrid        | a device running Capacitor or Cordova    |
| ios           | a device running iOS                     |
| ipad          | an iPad device                           |
| iphone        | an iPhone device                         |
| mobile        | a mobile device                          |
| mobileweb     | a web browser running in a mobile device |
| phablet       | a phablet device                         |
| pwa           | a PWA app                                |
| tablet        | a tablet device                          |

## Customizing Platform Detection Functions

The function used to detect a specific platform can be overridden by providing an alternative function in the global [Ionic config](../developing/config). Each function takes `window` as a parameter and returns a boolean.

```tsx
setupIonicReact({
  platform: {
    /** The default `desktop` function returns false for devices with a touchscreen.
     * This is not always wanted, so this function tests the User Agent instead.
     **/
    desktop: (win) => {
      const isMobile = /Android|webOS|iPhone|iPad|iPod|BlackBerry|IEMobile|Opera Mini/i.test(win.navigator.userAgent);
      return !isMobile;
    },
  },
});
```

```ts
type PlatformConfig = {
  android?: ((win: Window) => boolean) | undefined;
  capacitor?: ((win: Window) => boolean) | undefined;
  cordova?: ((win: Window) => boolean) | undefined;
  desktop?: ((win: Window) => boolean) | undefined;
  electron?: ((win: Window) => boolean) | undefined;
  hybrid?: ((win: Window) => boolean) | undefined;
  ios?: ((win: Window) => boolean) | undefined;
  ipad?: ((win: Window) => boolean) | undefined;
  iphone?: ((win: Window) => boolean) | undefined;
  mobile?: ((win: Window) => boolean) | undefined;
  mobileweb?: ((win: Window) => boolean) | undefined;
  phablet?: ((win: Window) => boolean) | undefined;
  pwa?: ((win: Window) => boolean) | undefined;
  tablet?: ((win: Window) => boolean) | undefined;
};
```

## Making your React app a PWA with Vite

The two main requirements of a PWA are a <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/primers/service-workers/" target="_blank">Service Worker</a> and a <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/web-app-manifest/" target="_blank">Web Application Manifest</a>. While it's possible to add both of these to an app manually, we recommend using the [Vite PWA Plugin](https://vite-pwa-org.netlify.app/) instead.

To get started, install the `vite-plugin-pwa` package:

```shell
npm install -D vite-plugin-pwa
```

Next, update your `vite.config.js` or `vite.config.ts` file and add `vite-plugin-pwa`:

```javascript
import { defineConfig } from 'vite';
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react';
import { VitePWA } from 'vite-plugin-pwa';

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react(), VitePWA({ registerType: 'autoUpdate' })],
});
```

This minimal configuration allows your application to generate the Web Application Manifest and Service Worker on build.

For more information on configuring the Vite PWA Plugin, see the [Vite PWA "Getting Started" Guide](https://vite-pwa-org.netlify.app/guide/).

See the [Vite PWA "Deploy" Guide](https://vite-pwa-org.netlify.app/deployment/) for information on how to deploy your PWA.

## Making your React app a PWA with Create React App

:::note
As of Ionic CLI v7, Ionic React starter apps ship with Vite instead of Create React App. See [Making your React app a PWA with Vite](#making-your-react-app-a-pwa-with-vite) for Vite instructions.
:::

The two main requirements of a PWA are a <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/primers/service-workers/" target="_blank">Service Worker</a> and a <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/web-app-manifest/" target="_blank">Web Application Manifest</a>. While it's possible to add both of these to an app manually, a base project from Create React App (CRA) and the Ionic CLI provides this already.

In the `index.ts` for your app, there is a call to a `serviceWorker.unregister()` function. The base that CRA provides has service workers as an opt-in feature, so it must be enabled. To enable, call `serviceWorker.register()`.

```ts
import React from 'react';
import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';
import App from './App';
import * as serviceWorkerRegistration from './serviceWorkerRegistration';

const container = document.getElementById('root');
const root = createRoot(container!);
root.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>
);

// If you want your app to work offline and load faster, you can change
// unregister() to register() below. Note this comes with some pitfalls.
// Learn more about service workers: https://cra.link/PWA
serviceWorkerRegistration.register();
```

Once this package has been added, run `ionic build` and the `build` directory will be ready to deploy as a PWA.

:::note
By default, react apps package comes with the Ionic logo for the app icons. Be sure to update the manifest to use the correct app name and also replace the icons.
:::

:::note
Features like Service Workers and many JavaScript APIs (such as geolocation) require the app to be hosted in a secure context. When deploying an app through a hosting service, be aware that HTTPS will be required to take full advantage of Service Workers.
:::

### Service Worker configuration

By default, CRA/React Scripts come with a preconfigured Service Worker setup based on [Workbox's Webpack plugin](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/modules/workbox-webpack-plugin). This utilizes a cache-first strategy, meaning that your app will load from a cache, even if the network returns a newer version of the app.

Because of the nature of CRA/React Scripts, the configuration for this is internal to React Scripts, meaning that it cannot be customized without ejecting from React Scripts. Currently, the Ionic CLI does not support an ejected React App, so if this action is taken, you'll need to use npm/yarn scripts instead of the Ionic CLI.

### Deploying

#### Firebase

Firebase hosting provides many benefits for Progressive Web Apps, including fast response times thanks to CDNs, HTTPS enabled by default, and support for [HTTP2 push](https://firebase.googleblog.com/2016/09/http2-comes-to-firebase-hosting.html).

First, if not already available, [create the project](https://console.firebase.google.com) in Firebase.

Next, in a Terminal, install the Firebase CLI:

```shell
npm install -g firebase-tools
```

:::note
If it's the first time you use firebase-tools, login to your Google account with `firebase login` command.
:::

With the Firebase CLI installed, run `firebase init` within your Ionic project. The CLI prompts:

**"Which Firebase CLI features do you want to set up for this folder?"** Choose "Hosting: Configure files for Firebase Hosting and (optionally) set up GitHub Action deploys".

Create a new Firebase project or select an existing one.

**"Select a default Firebase project for this directory:"** Choose the project you created on the Firebase website.

**"What do you want to use as your public directory?"** Enter "build".

:::note
Answering this next question will ensure that routing, hard reload, and deep linking work in the app:
:::

**Configure as a single-page app (rewrite all urls to /index.html)?"** Enter "Yes".

**"File build/index.html already exists. Overwrite?"** Enter "No".

**Set up automatic builds and deploys with Github?** Enter "Yes".

**For which GitHub repository would you like to set up a Github Workflow?** Enter your project name.

**Set up the workflow to run a build script before every deploy?** Enter "Yes".

**What script should be run before every deploy?** Enter `npm ci && npm run build`.

**Set up automatic deployment to your sites live channel when a PR is merged?** Enter "Yes".

**What is the name of the get hooked branch associated with your sites live channel?** Enter your project's main branch name.

A `firebase.json` config file is generated, configuring the app for deployment.

The last thing needed is to make sure caching headers are being set correctly. To do this, add a `headers` snippet to the `firebase.json` file. The complete `firebase.json` looks like:

```json
{
  "hosting": {
    "public": "build",
    "ignore": ["firebase.json", "**/.*", "**/node_modules/**"],
    "rewrites": [
      {
        "source": "**",
        "destination": "/index.html"
      }
    ],
    "headers": [
      {
        "source": "/**",
        "headers": [
          {
            "key": "Cache-Control",
            "value": "public, max-age=31536000"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

For more information about the `firebase.json` properties, see the [Firebase documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting/full-config#section-firebase-json).

Next, build an optimized version of the app by running:

```shell
ionic build --prod
```

Last, deploy the app by running:

```shell
firebase deploy
```

After this completes, the app will be live.

import DocsCards from '@components/global/DocsCards';

Welcome! This guide will walk you through the basics of Ionic React development. You'll learn how to set up your development environment, generate a simple project, explore the project structure, and understand how Ionic components work. This is perfect for getting familiar with Ionic React before building your first real app.

If you're looking for a high-level overview of what Ionic React is and how it fits into the React ecosystem, see the [Ionic React Overview](overview).

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine.
You can check by running:

```shell
node -v
npm -v
```

If you don't have Node.js and npm, [download Node.js here](https://nodejs.org/en/download) (which includes npm).

## Create a Project with the Ionic CLI

First, install the latest [Ionic CLI](../cli):

```shell
npm install -g @ionic/cli
```

Then, run the following commands to create and run a new project:

```shell
ionic start myApp blank --type react

cd myApp
ionic serve
```

After running `ionic serve`, your project will open in the browser.

![Screenshot of the Ionic React Home page](/img/guides/quickstart/home-page.png 'Ionic React Home Component')

## Explore the Project Structure

Your new app's `src` directory will look like this:

```shell
├── App.tsx
├── components
│   ├── ExploreContainer.css
│   └── ExploreContainer.tsx
├── main.tsx
└──  pages
    ├── Home.css
    └── Home.tsx
```

:::info
All file paths in the examples below are relative to the `src/` directory.
:::

Let's walk through these files to understand the app's structure.

## View the App Component

The root of your app is defined in `App.tsx`:

```tsx
import { Redirect, Route } from 'react-router-dom';
import { IonApp, IonRouterOutlet, setupIonicReact } from '@ionic/react';
import { IonReactRouter } from '@ionic/react-router';
import Home from './pages/Home';

// ..CSS imports...

setupIonicReact();

const App: React.FC = () => (
  <IonApp>
    <IonReactRouter>
      <IonRouterOutlet>
        <Route exact path="/home">
          <Home />
        </Route>
        <Route exact path="/">
          <Redirect to="/home" />
        </Route>
      </IonRouterOutlet>
    </IonReactRouter>
  </IonApp>
);

export default App;
```

This sets up the root of your application, using Ionic's `IonApp` and `IonReactRouter` components. The `IonRouterOutlet` is where your pages will be displayed.

## View Routes

Routes are defined within the `IonRouterOutlet` in `App.tsx`:

```tsx
<IonRouterOutlet>
  <Route exact path="/home">
    <Home />
  </Route>
  <Route exact path="/">
    <Redirect to="/home" />
  </Route>
</IonRouterOutlet>
```

When you visit the root URL (`/`), the `Home` component will be loaded.

## View the Home Page

The Home page component, defined in `pages/Home.tsx`, imports the Ionic components and defines the page template:

```tsx
import { IonContent, IonHeader, IonPage, IonTitle, IonToolbar } from '@ionic/react';
import ExploreContainer from '../components/ExploreContainer';
import './Home.css';

const Home: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <IonPage>
      <IonHeader>
        <IonToolbar>
          <IonTitle>Blank</IonTitle>
        </IonToolbar>
      </IonHeader>
      <IonContent fullscreen>
        <IonHeader collapse="condense">
          <IonToolbar>
            <IonTitle size="large">Blank</IonTitle>
          </IonToolbar>
        </IonHeader>
        <ExploreContainer />
      </IonContent>
    </IonPage>
  );
};

export default Home;
```

This creates a page with a header and scrollable content area. The `IonPage` component provides the basic page structure and must be used on every page. The second header shows a [collapsible large title](/docs/api/title#collapsible-large-titles) that displays when at the top of the content, then condenses to show the smaller title in the first header when scrolling down.

:::

## Add an Ionic Component

You can enhance your Home page with more Ionic UI components. For example, import and add a [Button](/docs/api/button) at the end of the `IonContent` in `pages/Home.tsx`:

```tsx
import { IonButton, IonContent, IonHeader, IonPage, IonTitle, IonToolbar } from '@ionic/react';
// ...existing imports...

const Home: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <IonPage>
      <IonHeader>
        <IonToolbar>
          <IonTitle>Blank</IonTitle>
        </IonToolbar>
      </IonHeader>
      <IonContent fullscreen>
        {/* ...existing content... */}

        <IonButton>Navigate</IonButton>
      </IonContent>
    </IonPage>
  );
};

export default Home;
```

## Add a New Page

Create a new page at `pages/New.tsx`:

```tsx
import { IonBackButton, IonButtons, IonContent, IonHeader, IonPage, IonTitle, IonToolbar } from '@ionic/react';

const New: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <IonPage>
      <IonHeader>
        <IonToolbar>
          <IonButtons slot="start">
            <IonBackButton defaultHref="/"></IonBackButton>
          </IonButtons>
          <IonTitle>New</IonTitle>
        </IonToolbar>
      </IonHeader>
      <IonContent fullscreen>
        <IonHeader collapse="condense">
          <IonToolbar>
            <IonTitle size="large">New</IonTitle>
          </IonToolbar>
        </IonHeader>
      </IonContent>
    </IonPage>
  );
};

export default New;
```

This creates a page with a [Back Button](/docs/api/back-button) in the [Toolbar](/docs/api/toolbar). The back button will automatically handle navigation back to the previous page, or to `/` if there is no history.

:::warning Important
When creating your own pages, always use `IonPage` as the root component. This is essential for proper transitions between pages, base CSS styling that Ionic components depend on, and consistent layout behavior across your app.
:::

## Navigate to the New Page

To navigate to the new page, create a route for it by first importing it at the top of `App.tsx` after the `Home` import:

```tsx
import New from './pages/New';
```

Then, add its route in `IonRouterOutlet`:

```tsx
<IonRouterOutlet>
  <Route exact path="/home">
    <Home />
  </Route>
  <Route exact path="/new">
    <New />
  </Route>
  <Route exact path="/">
    <Redirect to="/home" />
  </Route>
</IonRouterOutlet>
```

Once that is done, update the button in `pages/Home.tsx`:

```tsx
<IonButton routerLink="/new">Navigate</IonButton>
```

:::info
Navigating can also be performed programmatically using React Router's `history` prop. See the [React Navigation documentation](/docs/react/navigation#navigating-using-history) for more information.
:::

## Add Icons to the New Page

Ionic React comes with [Ionicons](https://ionic.io/ionicons/) pre-installed. You can use any icon by setting the `icon` property of the `IonIcon` component.

Update the imports in `pages/New.tsx` to import `IonIcon` and the `heart` and `logoIonic` icons:

```tsx
import { IonBackButton, IonButtons, IonContent, IonHeader, IonIcon, IonPage, IonTitle, IonToolbar } from '@ionic/react';
import { heart, logoIonic } from 'ionicons/icons';
```

Then, include them inside of the `IonContent`:

```tsx
<IonIcon icon={heart} />
<IonIcon icon={logoIonic} />
```

Note that we are passing the imported SVG reference, **not** the icon name as a string.

For more information, see the [Icon documentation](/docs/api/icon) and the [Ionicons documentation](https://ionic.io/ionicons/).

## Call Component Methods

Let's add a button that can scroll the content area to the bottom.

Update `pages/New.tsx` to add a `ref` on `IonContent` and a button and some items after the existing icons:

```tsx
<IonContent ref={content}>
  <IonIcon icon={heart} />
  <IonIcon icon={logoIonic} />

  <IonButton onClick={scrollToBottom}>Scroll to Bottom</IonButton>

  {/* Add lots of content to make scrolling possible */}
  {Array.from({ length: 50 }, (_, i) => (
    <IonItem key={i}>
      <IonLabel>Item {i + 1}</IonLabel>
    </IonItem>
  ))}
</IonContent>
```

Then, add the imports for the additional components and define the `scrollToBottom` function:

```tsx
import { useRef } from 'react';
import { IonButton, IonBackButton, IonButtons, IonContent, IonHeader, IonIcon, IonItem, IonLabel, IonPage, IonTitle, IonToolbar } from '@ionic/react';
import { heart, logoIonic } from 'ionicons/icons';

const New: React.FC = () => {
  const content = useRef<HTMLIonContentElement>(null);

  const scrollToBottom = () => {
    content.current?.scrollToBottom(300);
  };

  return (
    // ...existing template...
  );
};

export default New;
```

To call methods on Ionic components:

1. Create a `ref` for the component
2. Call the method directly on `ref.current`

This pattern is necessary because React refs store the component instance in the `.current` property.

You can find available methods for each component in the [Methods](/docs/api/content#methods) section of their API documentation.

## Run on a Device

Ionic's components work everywhere: on iOS, Android, and PWAs. To deploy to mobile, use [Capacitor](https://capacitorjs.com):

```shell
ionic build
ionic cap add ios
ionic cap add android
```

Open the native projects in their IDEs:

```shell
ionic cap open ios
ionic cap open android
```

See [Capacitor's Getting Started guide](https://capacitorjs.com/docs/getting-started/with-ionic) for more.

title: Migrating From IonSlides to Swiper.js
---

<head>
  <title>Set Up Swiper.js for React Slides [Example] | Ionic</title>
  <meta
    name="description"
    content="We recommend Swiper.js if you need a modern touch slider component. Get Swiper for React set up in your application and learn how to migrate from IonSlides."
  />
</head>

:::warning Looking for `IonSlides`?

`IonSlides` was deprecated in v6.0.0 and removed in v7.0.0. We recommend using the Swiper.js library directly. The migration process is detailed below.

:::

We recommend <a href="http://swiperjs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Swiper.js</a> if you need a modern touch slider component. This guide will go over how to get Swiper for React set up in your Ionic Framework application. It will also go over any migration information you may need to move from `IonSlides` to the official Swiper React integration.

:::note
Swiper's React component is set to be removed in a future release of Swiper, with <a href="https://swiperjs.com/element" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Swiper Element</a> as the replacement. However, this guide shows how to migrate to the React component because it provides the most stable experience at the time of writing. Notably, React does not have strong support for Web Components yet.

Using Swiper's React component is **not** required to use Swiper.js with Ionic Framework.
:::

## Getting Started

First, update to the latest version of Ionic:

```shell
npm install @ionic/react@latest @ionic/react-router@latest
```

Once that is done, install the Swiper dependency in your project:

```shell
npm install swiper@latest
```

:::note
Developers using Create React App must use `react-scripts` v5.0.0+ with the latest version of Swiper.
:::

## Swiping with Style

Next, we need to import the base Swiper styles. We are also going to import the styles that Ionic provides which will let us customize the Swiper styles using the same CSS Variables that we used with `IonSlides`.

We recommend importing the styles in the component in which Swiper is being used. This ensures that the styles are only loaded when needed:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { IonContent, IonPage } from '@ionic/react';
import { Swiper, SwiperSlide } from 'swiper/react';

import 'swiper/css';
import '@ionic/react/css/ionic-swiper.css';

const Home: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    ...
  );
};
export default Home;
```

:::note
Importing `@ionic/react/css/ionic-swiper.css` is **not** required to use Swiper.js with Ionic. This files is used for backward-compatibility with the `IonSlides` component and can be safely omitted if you prefer not to use the CSS Variables provided in the stylesheet.
:::

### Updating Selectors

Previously, we were able to target `ion-slides` and `ion-slide` to apply any custom styling. The contents of those style blocks remain the same, but we need to update the selectors. Below is a list of selector changes when going from `ion-slides` to Swiper React:

| ion-slides Selector | Swiper Selector |
| ------------------- | --------------- |
| `ion-slides`        | `.swiper`       |
| `ion-slide`         | `.swiper-slide` |

### Pre-processors (optional)

For developers using SCSS or Less styles, Swiper also provides imports for those files.

For Less styles, replace `css` with `less` in the Swiper import path:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { IonContent, IonPage } from '@ionic/react';
import { Swiper, SwiperSlide } from 'swiper/react';

import 'swiper/less';
import '@ionic/react/css/ionic-swiper.css';

const Home: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    ...
  );
};
export default Home;
```

For SCSS styles replace `css` with `scss` in the Swiper import path:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { IonContent, IonPage } from '@ionic/react';
import { Swiper, SwiperSlide } from 'swiper/react';

import 'swiper/scss';
import '@ionic/react/css/ionic-swiper.css';

const Home: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    ...
  );
};
export default Home;
```

## Using Components

Swiper exports two components: `Swiper` and `SwiperSlide`. The `Swiper` component is the equivalent of `IonSlides`, and `SwiperSlide` is the equivalent of `IonSlide`.

These components are imported from `swiper/react`:

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { IonContent, IonPage } from '@ionic/react';
import { Swiper, SwiperSlide } from 'swiper/react';

import 'swiper/css';
import '@ionic/react/css/ionic-swiper.css';

const Home: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <IonPage>
      <IonContent>
        <Swiper>
          <SwiperSlide>Slide 1</SwiperSlide>
          <SwiperSlide>Slide 2</SwiperSlide>
          <SwiperSlide>Slide 3</SwiperSlide>
        </Swiper>
      </IonContent>
    </IonPage>
  );
};
export default Home;
```

## Using Modules

By default, Swiper for React does not import any additional modules. To use modules such as Navigation or Pagination, you need to import them first.

`IonSlides` automatically included the Pagination, Scrollbar, Autoplay, Keyboard, and Zoom modules. This part of the guide will show you how to install these modules.

To begin, we need to import the modules and their corresponding CSS files from the `swiper` package:

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { IonContent, IonPage } from '@ionic/react';
import { Swiper, SwiperSlide } from 'swiper/react';
import { Autoplay, Keyboard, Pagination, Scrollbar, Zoom } from 'swiper/modules';

import 'swiper/css';
import 'swiper/css/autoplay';
import 'swiper/css/keyboard';
import 'swiper/css/pagination';
import 'swiper/css/scrollbar';
import 'swiper/css/zoom';
import '@ionic/react/css/ionic-swiper.css';

const Home: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <IonPage>
      <IonContent>
        <Swiper>
          <SwiperSlide>Slide 1</SwiperSlide>
          <SwiperSlide>Slide 2</SwiperSlide>
          <SwiperSlide>Slide 3</SwiperSlide>
        </Swiper>
      </IonContent>
    </IonPage>
  );
};
export default Home;
```

From here, we need to provide these modules to Swiper by using the `modules` property on the `Swiper` component:

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { IonContent, IonPage } from '@ionic/react';
import { Swiper, SwiperSlide } from 'swiper/react';
import { Autoplay, Keyboard, Pagination, Scrollbar, Zoom } from 'swiper/modules';

import 'swiper/css';
import 'swiper/css/autoplay';
import 'swiper/css/keyboard';
import 'swiper/css/pagination';
import 'swiper/css/scrollbar';
import 'swiper/css/zoom';
import '@ionic/react/css/ionic-swiper.css';

const Home: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <IonPage>
      <IonContent>
        <Swiper modules={[Autoplay, Keyboard, Pagination, Scrollbar, Zoom]}>
          <SwiperSlide>Slide 1</SwiperSlide>
          <SwiperSlide>Slide 2</SwiperSlide>
          <SwiperSlide>Slide 3</SwiperSlide>
        </Swiper>
      </IonContent>
    </IonPage>
  );
};
export default Home;
```

Finally, we can turn these features on by using the appropriate properties:

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { IonContent, IonPage } from '@ionic/react';
import { Swiper, SwiperSlide } from 'swiper/react';
import { Autoplay, Keyboard, Pagination, Scrollbar, Zoom } from 'swiper/modules';

import 'swiper/css';
import 'swiper/css/autoplay';
import 'swiper/css/keyboard';
import 'swiper/css/pagination';
import 'swiper/css/scrollbar';
import 'swiper/css/zoom';
import '@ionic/react/css/ionic-swiper.css';

const Home: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <IonPage>
      <IonContent>
        <Swiper
          modules={[Autoplay, Keyboard, Pagination, Scrollbar, Zoom]}
          autoplay={true}
          keyboard={true}
          pagination={true}
          scrollbar={true}
          zoom={true}
        >
          <SwiperSlide>Slide 1</SwiperSlide>
          <SwiperSlide>Slide 2</SwiperSlide>
          <SwiperSlide>Slide 3</SwiperSlide>
        </Swiper>
      </IonContent>
    </IonPage>
  );
};
export default Home;
```

:::note
See <a href="https://swiperjs.com/react#usage" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://swiperjs.com/react#usage</a> for a full list of modules.
:::

## The IonicSlides Module

With `IonSlides`, Ionic automatically customized dozens of Swiper properties. This resulted in an experience that felt smooth when swiping on mobile devices. We recommend using the `IonicSlides` module to ensure that these properties are also set when using Swiper directly. However, using this module is **not** required to use Swiper.js in Ionic.

It is recommended to review the [properties](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-framework/blob/main/core/src/components/slides/IonicSlides.ts) set by `IonicSlides` and determine which ones you would like to customize.

We can install the `IonicSlides` module by importing it from `@ionic/react` and passing it in as the last item in the `modules` array:

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { IonContent, IonPage, IonicSlides } from '@ionic/react';
import { Swiper, SwiperSlide } from 'swiper/react';
import { Autoplay, Keyboard, Pagination, Scrollbar, Zoom } from 'swiper/modules';

import 'swiper/css';
import 'swiper/css/autoplay';
import 'swiper/css/keyboard';
import 'swiper/css/pagination';
import 'swiper/css/scrollbar';
import 'swiper/css/zoom';
import '@ionic/react/css/ionic-swiper.css';

const Home: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <IonPage>
      <IonContent>
        <Swiper
          modules={[Autoplay, Keyboard, Pagination, Scrollbar, Zoom, IonicSlides]}
          autoplay={true}
          keyboard={true}
          pagination={true}
          scrollbar={true}
          zoom={true}
        >
          <SwiperSlide>Slide 1</SwiperSlide>
          <SwiperSlide>Slide 2</SwiperSlide>
          <SwiperSlide>Slide 3</SwiperSlide>
        </Swiper>
      </IonContent>
    </IonPage>
  );
};
export default Home;
```

:::note
The `IonicSlides` module must be the last module in the array. This will let it automatically customize the settings of modules such as Pagination, Scrollbar, Zoom, and more.
:::

## Properties

Swiper options are provided as props directly on the `<Swiper>` component rather than via the `options` object in `IonSlides`.

Let's say in an app with `IonSlides` we had the `slidesPerView` and `loop` options set:

```tsx
const MyComponent: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <IonSlides
      options={{
        slidesPerView: 3,
        loop: true,
      }}
    >
      <IonSlide>Slide 1</IonSlide>
      <IonSlide>Slide 2</IonSlide>
      <IonSlide>Slide 3</IonSlide>
    </IonSlides>
  );
};
```

To migrate, we would move these options out of the `options` object and onto the `<Swiper>` component directly as properties:

```tsx
const MyComponent: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <Swiper slidesPerView={3} loop={true}>
      <SwiperSlide>Slide 1</SwiperSlide>
      <SwiperSlide>Slide 2</SwiperSlide>
      <SwiperSlide>Slide 3</SwiperSlide>
    </Swiper>
  );
};
```

Below is a full list of property changes when going from `IonSlides` to Swiper React:

| Name      | Notes                                                                                                                 |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| options   | Set each option as a property directly on the `<Swiper>` component.                                                   |
| mode      | For different styles based upon the mode, you can target the slides with `.ios .swiper` or `.md .swiper` in your CSS. |
| pager     | Use the `pagination` property instead. Requires installation of the Pagination module.                                |
| scrollbar | You can continue to use the `scrollbar` property, just be sure to install the Scrollbar module first.                 |

:::note
All properties available in Swiper React can be found at <a href="https://swiperjs.com/react#swiper-props" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://swiperjs.com/react#swiper-props</a>.
:::

## Events

Since the `Swiper` component is not provided by Ionic Framework, event names will not have an `onIonSlide` prefix to them.

Let's say in an app with `IonSlides` we used the `onIonSlideDidChange` event:

```tsx
const MyComponent: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <IonSlides onIonSlideDidChange={() => onSlideChange()}>
      <IonSlide>Slide 1</IonSlide>
      <IonSlide>Slide 2</IonSlide>
      <IonSlide>Slide 3</IonSlide>
    </IonSlides>
  );
};
```

To migrate, we would change the name of the event to `onSlideChange`:

```tsx
const MyComponent: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <Swiper onSlideChange={() => onSlideChange()}>
      <SwiperSlide>Slide 1</SwiperSlide>
      <SwiperSlide>Slide 2</SwiperSlide>
      <SwiperSlide>Slide 3</SwiperSlide>
    </Swiper>
  );
};
```

Below is a full list of event name changes when going from `IonSlides` to Swiper React:

| IonSlides Event             | Swiper Event                   |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `onIonSlideWillChange`      | `onSlideChangeTransitionStart` |
| `onIonSlideDidChange`       | `onSlideChangeTransitionEnd`   |
| `onIonSlideDoubleTap`       | `onDoubleTap`                  |
| `onIonSlideDrag`            | `onSliderMove`                 |
| `onIonSlideNextStart`       | `onSlideNextTransitionStart`   |
| `onIonSlideNextEnd`         | `onSlideNextTransitionEnd`     |
| `onIonSlidePrevStart`       | `onSlidePrevTransitionStart`   |
| `onIonSlidePrevEnd`         | `onSlidePrevTransitionEnd`     |
| `onIonSlideReachStart`      | `onReachBeginning`             |
| `onIonSlideReachEnd`        | `onReachEnd`                   |
| `onIonSlideTap`             | `onTap`                        |
| `onIonSlideTouchStart`      | `onTouchStart`                 |
| `onIonSlideTouchEnd`        | `onTouchEnd`                   |
| `onIonSlideTransitionStart` | `onTransitionStart`            |
| `onIonSlideTransitionEnd`   | `onTransitionEnd`              |
| `onIonSlidesDidLoad`        | `onInit`                       |

:::

## Methods

Most methods have been removed in favor of accessing the `Swiper` props directly.

Accessing these properties can be tricky as you want to access the properties on the Swiper instance itself, not your React component. To do this, we recommend getting a reference to the `Swiper` instance via `onSwiper`:

```tsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { Swiper, SwiperSlide } from 'swiper/react';
import { Swiper as SwiperInterface } from 'swiper';
...
const Home: React.FC = () => {
  const [swiperInstance, setSwiperInstance] = useState<SwiperInterface>();
  return (
    ...
    <Swiper
      onSwiper={(swiper) => setSwiperInstance(swiper)}
    >
      ...
    </Swiper>
  )
};
export default Home;
```

From here, if you wanted to access a property on the Swiper instance you would access `swiperInstance`. For example, if you wanted to check the `isBeginning` property, you could do: `swiperInstance.isBeginning`. Make sure `swiperInstance` is defined first though!

Below is a full list of method changes when going from `IonSlides` to Swiper React:

| IonSlides Method     | Notes                                                                                |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `getActiveIndex()`   | Use the `activeIndex` property instead.                                              |
| `getPreviousIndex()` | Use the `previousIndex` property instead.                                            |
| `getSwiper()`        | Get a reference to the Swiper instance using `onSwiper`. See example above.          |
| `isBeginning()`      | Use the `isBeginning` property instead.                                              |
| `isEnd()`            | Use the `isEnd` property instead.                                                    |
| `length()`           | Use the `slides` property instead. (i.e swiperRef.slides.length)                     |
| `lockSwipeToNext()`  | Use the `allowSlidesNext` property instead.                                          |
| `lockSwipeToPrev()`  | Use the `allowSlidePrev` property instead.                                           |
| `lockSwipes()`       | Use the `allowSlideNext`, `allowSlidePrev`, and `allowTouchMove` properties instead. |
| `startAutoplay()`    | Use the `autoplay` property instead.                                                 |
| `stopAutoplay()`     | Use the `autoplay` property instead.                                                 |

## Effects

If you are using effects such as Cube or Fade, you can install them just like we did with the other modules. In this example, we will use the fade effect. To start, we will import `EffectFade` from `swiper` and provide it in the `modules` array:

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { IonContent, IonPage, IonicSlides } from '@ionic/react';
import { EffectFade } from 'swiper/modules';
import { Swiper, SwiperSlide } from 'swiper/react';

import 'swiper/css';
import '@ionic/react/css/ionic-swiper.css';

const Home: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <IonPage>
      <IonContent>
        <Swiper modules={[EffectFade, IonicSlides]}>
          <SwiperSlide>Slide 1</SwiperSlide>
          <SwiperSlide>Slide 2</SwiperSlide>
          <SwiperSlide>Slide 3</SwiperSlide>
        </Swiper>
      </IonContent>
    </IonPage>
  );
};
export default Home;
```

Next, we need to import the stylesheet associated with the effect:

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { IonContent, IonPage, IonicSlides } from '@ionic/react';
import { EffectFade } from 'swiper/modules';
import { Swiper, SwiperSlide } from 'swiper/react';

import 'swiper/css';
import 'swiper/css/effect-fade';
import '@ionic/react/css/ionic-swiper.css';

const Home: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <IonPage>
      <IonContent>
        <Swiper modules={[EffectFade, IonicSlides]}>
          <SwiperSlide>Slide 1</SwiperSlide>
          <SwiperSlide>Slide 2</SwiperSlide>
          <SwiperSlide>Slide 3</SwiperSlide>
        </Swiper>
      </IonContent>
    </IonPage>
  );
};
export default Home;
```

After that, we can activate it by setting the `effect` property on `swiper` to `"fade"`:

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { IonContent, IonPage, IonicSlides } from '@ionic/react';
import { EffectFade } from 'swiper/modules';
import { Swiper, SwiperSlide } from 'swiper/react';

import 'swiper/css';
import 'swiper/css/effect-fade';
import '@ionic/react/css/ionic-swiper.css';

const Home: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <IonPage>
      <IonContent>
        <Swiper modules={[EffectFade, IonicSlides]} effect="fade">
          <SwiperSlide>Slide 1</SwiperSlide>
          <SwiperSlide>Slide 2</SwiperSlide>
          <SwiperSlide>Slide 3</SwiperSlide>
        </Swiper>
      </IonContent>
    </IonPage>
  );
};
export default Home;
```

    content="A variety of options are available for storing data within Ionic apps made using React. Choose the options that best fit your storage needs."
  />
</head>

There are a variety of options available for storing data within an Ionic application. It is best to choose options that best fit the needs of your application. A single application may have requirements that span multiple options.

:::info
Some storage options involve third-party plugins or products. In such cases, we neither endorse nor support those plugins or products. We are mentioning them here for informational purposes only.
:::

Here are some common use cases and solutions:

## Local Application Settings and Data

Many applications need to locally store settings as well as other lightweight key/value data. The [Capacitor Preferences](https://capacitorjs.com/docs/apis/preferences) plugin is specifically designed to handle these scenarios.

## Relational Data Storage (Mobile Only)

Some applications, especially those following an offline-first methodology, may require locally storing high volumes of complex relational data. For such scenarios, a SQLite plugin may be used. The most common SQLite plugin offerings are:

- [Cordova SQLite Storage](https://github.com/storesafe/cordova-sqlite-storage) (a [convenience wrapper](https://danielsogl.gitbook.io/awesome-cordova-plugins/sqlite) also exists for this plugin to aid in implementation)
- [Capacitor Community SQLite Plugin](https://github.com/capacitor-community/sqlite)

## Non-Relational High Volume Data Storage (Mobile and Web)

For applications that need to store a high volume of data as well as operate on both web and mobile, a potential solution is to create a key/value pair data storage service that uses [indexedDB](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API) on the web and one of the previously mentioned SQLite plugins on mobile.

Here a sample of how this can be accomplished:

- [Full application](https://github.com/ionic-enterprise/tutorials-and-demos-react/tree/main/demos/sqlcipher-kv-pair)
- [Mobile Service](https://github.com/ionic-enterprise/tutorials-and-demos-react/blob/main/demos/sqlcipher-kv-pair/src/utils/mobile-kv-store.ts)
- [Web Service](https://github.com/ionic-enterprise/tutorials-and-demos-react/blob/main/demos/sqlcipher-kv-pair/src/utils/web-kv-store.ts)

## Other Options

Other storage options that provide local as well as cloud-based storage that work well within Capacitor applications also exist and may integrate well with your application.

For example:

- [PouchDB](https://pouchdb.com/)
- [Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore)

# Testing Ionic React

This document provides an overview of how to test an application built with `@ionic/react`. It covers the basics of testing with React, as well as the specific tools and libraries developers can use to test their applications.

## Introduction

Testing is an important part of the development process, and it helps to ensure that an application is working as intended. In `@ionic/react`, testing is done using a combination of tools and libraries, including Jest or Vitest, React Testing Library, Playwright or Cypress.

## Types of Tests

There are two types of tests that can be written:

**Unit Tests**: Unit tests are used to test individual functions and components in isolation. [Jest](https://jestjs.io), [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) and [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com) are commonly used for unit testing.

**Integration Tests**: Integration tests are used to test how different components work together. [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io) or [Playwright](https://playwright.dev) are commonly used for integration testing.

-------- ./react/testing/unit-testing/best-practices.md --------
---
sidebar_label: Best Practices

# Best Practices

## IonApp is required for test templates

In your test template when rendering with React Testing Library, you must wrap your component with an `IonApp` component. This is required for the component to be rendered correctly.

```tsx title="Example.test.tsx"
import { IonApp } from '@ionic/react';
import { render } from "@testing-library/react";

import Example from './Example';

test('example', () => {
  render(
    <IonApp>
      <Example />
    </IonApp>
  );
  ...
});
```

## Use `user-event` for user interactions

React Testing Library recommends using the `user-event` library for simulating user interactions. This library provides a more realistic simulation of user interactions than the `fireEvent` function provided by React Testing Library.

```tsx title="Example.test.tsx"
import { IonApp } from '@ionic/react';
import { render } from '@testing-library/react';
import userEvent from '@testing-library/user-event';

import Example from './Example';

test('example', async () => {
  const user = userEvent.setup();

  render(
    <IonApp>
      <Example />
    </IonApp>
  );

  await user.click(screen.getByRole('button', { name: /click me!/i }));
});
```

For more information on `user-event`, see the [user-event documentation](https://testing-library.com/docs/user-event/intro/).

# Examples

## Testing a modal presented from a trigger

This example shows how to test a modal that is presented from a trigger. The modal is presented when the user clicks a button.

### Example component

```tsx title="src/Example.tsx"
import { IonButton, IonModal } from '@ionic/react';

export default function Example() {
  return (
    <>
      <IonButton id="open-modal">Open</IonButton>
      <IonModal trigger="open-modal">Modal content</IonModal>
    </>
  );
}
```

### Testing the modal

```tsx title="src/Example.test.tsx"
import { IonApp } from '@ionic/react';
import { fireEvent, render, screen, waitFor } from '@testing-library/react';

import Example from './Example';

test('button presents a modal when clicked', async () => {
  render(
    <IonApp>
      <Example />
    </IonApp>
  );
  // Simulate a click on the button
  fireEvent.click(screen.getByText('Open'));
  // Wait for the modal to be presented
  await waitFor(() => {
    // Assert that the modal is present
    expect(screen.getByText('Modal content')).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
});
```

## Testing a modal presented from useIonModal

This example shows how to test a modal that is presented using the `useIonModal` hook. The modal is presented when the user clicks a button.

### Example component

```tsx title="src/Example.tsx"
import { IonContent, useIonModal, IonHeader, IonToolbar, IonTitle, IonButton, IonPage } from '@ionic/react';

const ModalContent: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <IonContent>
      <div>Modal Content</div>
    </IonContent>
  );
};

const Example: React.FC = () => {
  const [present] = useIonModal(ModalContent);
  return (
    <IonPage>
      <IonHeader>
        <IonToolbar>
          <IonTitle>Blank</IonTitle>
        </IonToolbar>
      </IonHeader>
      <IonContent fullscreen={true}>
        <IonButton expand="block" className="ion-margin" onClick={() => present()}>
          Open
        </IonButton>
      </IonContent>
    </IonPage>
  );
};

export default Example;
```

### Testing the modal

```tsx title="src/Example.test.tsx"
import { IonApp } from '@ionic/react';
import { fireEvent, render, screen, waitFor } from '@testing-library/react';

import Example from './Example';

test('should present ModalContent when button is clicked', async () => {
  render(
    <IonApp>
      <Example />
    </IonApp>
  );
  // Simulate a click on the button
  fireEvent.click(screen.getByText('Open'));
  // Wait for the modal to be presented
  await waitFor(() => {
    // Assert that the modal is present
    expect(screen.getByText('Modal Content')).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
});
```

# Unit Testing Setup

Ionic requires a few additional steps to set up unit tests. If you are using an Ionic starter project, these steps have already been completed for you.

### Install React Testing Library

React Testing Library is a set of utilities that make it easier to test React components. It's used to interact with components and test their behavior.

```bash
npm install --save-dev @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom @testing-library/user-event
```

### Initialize Ionic React

Ionic React requires the `setupIonicReact` function to be called before any tests are run. Failing to do so will result in mode-based classes and platform behaviors not being applied to your components.

In `src/setupTest.ts`, add the following code:

```diff
import '@testing-library/jest-dom/extend-expect';

+ import { setupIonicReact } from '@ionic/react';

+ setupIonicReact();

// Mock matchmedia
window.matchMedia = window.matchMedia || function () {
  return {
    matches: false,
    addListener: function () { },
    removeListener: function () { }
  };
};
```

-------- ./react/virtual-scroll.md --------
# Virtual Scroll

:::warning Looking for `ion-virtual-scroll`?

`ion-virtual-scroll` was deprecated in v6.0.0 and removed in v7.0.0. We recommend using the Virtuoso package detailed below.

:::

One virtual scrolling solution to consider for your Ionic React app is [Virtuoso](https://virtuoso.dev/). This guide will go over how to install `Virtuoso` into your Ionic React application and use it with other Ionic components.

## Installation

To setup the virtual scroller, first install `react-virtuoso`:

```shell
npm install react-virtuoso
```

## Usage

There are a few components that Virtuoso includes, but this example will use the `Virtuoso` component. This component should be added inside of your `IonContent` component:

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { Virtuoso } from 'react-virtuoso';
import { IonAvatar, IonContent, IonItem, IonLabel, IonPage } from '@ionic/react';
const Home: React.FC = () => (
  <IonPage>
    <IonContent>
      <Virtuoso
        style={{ height: '100%' }}
        totalCount={100}
        itemContent={(index) => {
          return (
            <div style={{ height: '56px' }}>
              <IonItem>
                <IonAvatar slot="start">
                  <img src="https://picsum.photos/seed/picsum/40/40" />
                </IonAvatar>
                <IonLabel>{index}</IonLabel>
              </IonItem>
            </div>
          );
        }}
      />
    </IonContent>
  </IonPage>
);
export default Home;
```

After adding the `Virtuoso` component to our page, we need to define the size of the virtual scroll container. In this case, we want the container to take up the full height of the screen which we can do by adding `style={{ height: '100%' }}`.

Next, we want to define the total number of items to render via the `totalCount` property.

From there, we can use the `itemContent` property to pass a function that will be called to render each item in our virtual scroll content.

An important thing to note here is the `div` that wraps our `IonItem` component. When lazy loading Ionic components, there may be a few frames where the component is loaded but the styles have not loaded in. When this happens, the component's dimension will be `0`, and Virtuoso may throw an error. This is because Virtuoso needs distinct positions for each item it renders, and it cannot determine that when a component's dimension is `0`.

## Usage with Ionic Components

Ionic Framework requires that features such as collapsible large titles, `ion-infinite-scroll`, `ion-refresher`, and `ion-reorder-group` be used within an `ion-content`. To use these experiences with virtual scrolling, you must add the `.ion-content-scroll-host` class to the virtual scroll viewport.

For example:

```tsx
<IonPage>
  <IonContent scrollY={false}>
    <Virtuoso className="ion-content-scroll-host">{/* Your existing content and configurations */}</Virtuoso>
  </IonContent>
</IonPage>
```

## Further Reading

This guide only covers a small portion of what `Virtuoso` is capable of. For more details, please see the [Virtuoso documentation](https://virtuoso.dev/).

## What We'll Build

We'll create a Photo Gallery app that offers the ability to take photos with your device's camera, display them in a grid, and store them permanently on the device.

Highlights include:

- One React-based codebase that runs on the web, iOS, and Android using Ionic Framework [UI components](https://ionicframework.com/docs/components).
- Deployed as a native iOS and Android mobile app using [Capacitor](https://capacitorjs.com), Ionic's official native app runtime.
- Photo Gallery functionality powered by the Capacitor [Camera](https://capacitorjs.com/docs/apis/camera), [Filesystem](https://capacitorjs.com/docs/apis/filesystem), and [Preferences](https://capacitorjs.com/docs/apis/preferences) APIs.

Find the complete app code referenced in this guide [on GitHub](https://github.com/ionic-team/photo-gallery-capacitor-react).

## Download Required Tools

Download and install these right away to ensure an optimal Ionic development experience:

- **Node.js** for interacting with the Ionic ecosystem. [Download the LTS version here](https://nodejs.org/en/).
- **A code editor** for... writing code! We are fans of [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
- **Command-line interface/terminal (CLI)**:
  - **Windows** users: for the best Ionic experience, we recommend the built-in command line (cmd) or the Powershell
    CLI, running in Administrator mode.
  - **Mac/Linux** users, virtually any terminal will work.

## Install Ionic Tooling

Run the following in the command line terminal to install the Ionic CLI (`ionic`), `native-run`, used to run native binaries on devices and simulators/emulators, and `cordova-res`, used to generate native app icons and splash screens:

:::note
To open a terminal in Visual Studio Code, go to Terminal -> New Terminal.
:::

```shell
npm install -g @ionic/cli native-run cordova-res
```

:::note
The `-g` option means _install globally_. When packages are installed globally, `EACCES` permission errors can occur.

Consider setting up npm to operate globally without elevated permissions. See [Resolving Permission Errors](../developing/tips.md#resolving-permission-errors) for more information.
:::

## Create an App

Next, create an Ionic React app that uses the “Tabs” starter template and adds Capacitor for native functionality:

```shell
ionic start photo-gallery tabs --type=react --capacitor
```

This starter project comes complete with three pre-built pages and best practices for Ionic development. With common building blocks already in place, we can add more features easily!

Next, change into the app folder:

```shell
cd photo-gallery
```

Next we'll need to install the necessary Capacitor plugins to make the app's native functionality work:

```shell
npm install @capacitor/camera @capacitor/preferences @capacitor/filesystem
```

### PWA Elements

Some Capacitor plugins, including the Camera API, provide the web-based functionality and UI via the Ionic [PWA Elements library](https://github.com/ionic-team/pwa-elements).

It's a separate dependency, so install it next:

```shell
npm install @ionic/pwa-elements
```

After installation, open up the project in your code editor of choice.

Next, import `@ionic/pwa-elements` by editing `src/main.tsx`.

```tsx
import { defineCustomElements } from '@ionic/pwa-elements/loader';

// Call the element loader before the render call
defineCustomElements(window);
```

That’s it! Now for the fun part - let’s see the app in action.

## Run the App

Run this command in your shell:

```shell
ionic serve
```

And voilà! Your Ionic app is now running in a web browser. Most of your app can be built and tested right in the browser, greatly increasing development and testing speed.

## Photo Gallery!!!

There are three tabs. Click on the Tab2 tab. It’s a blank canvas, aka the perfect spot to transform into a Photo Gallery. The Ionic CLI features Live Reload, so when you make changes and save them, the app is updated immediately!

![Animated GIF showing the live reload feature in an Ionic app, with changes in code immediately updating the app in a web browser.](/img/guides/react/first-app/live-reload.gif 'Live Reload Feature in Ionic App')

Open `/src/pages/Tab2.tsx`. We see:

```tsx
<IonPage>
  <IonHeader>
    <IonToolbar>
      <IonTitle>Tab 2</IonTitle>
    </IonToolbar>
  </IonHeader>
  <IonContent>
  <!-- some filler -->
  </IonContent>
</IonPage>
```

`IonHeader` represents the top navigation and toolbar, with "Tab 2" as the title. Let’s rename it:

```tsx
<IonTitle>Photo Gallery</IonTitle>
```

We put the visual aspects of our app into `<IonContent>`. In this case, it’s where we’ll add a button that opens the device’s camera as well as displays the image captured by the camera. Start by adding a [floating action button](https://ionicframework.com/docs/api/fab) (FAB). First, update the imports at the top of the page to include the Camera icon as well as some of the Ionic components we'll use shortly:

```tsx
import { camera, trash, close } from 'ionicons/icons';
import {
  IonContent,
  IonHeader,
  IonPage,
  IonTitle,
  IonToolbar,
  IonFab,
  IonFabButton,
  IonIcon,
  IonGrid,
  IonRow,
  IonCol,
  IonImg,
  IonActionSheet,
} from '@ionic/react';
```

Then, add the FAB to the bottom of the page. Use the camera image as the icon, and call the `takePhoto()` function when this button is clicked (to be implemented soon):

```tsx
<IonContent>
  <IonFab vertical="bottom" horizontal="center" slot="fixed">
    <IonFabButton onClick={() => takePhoto()}>
      <IonIcon icon={camera}></IonIcon>
    </IonFabButton>
  </IonFab>
</IonContent>
```

We’ll be creating the `takePhoto` method and the logic to use the Camera and other native features in a moment.

Next, open `src/App.tsx`, remove the `ellipse` icon from the import and import the `images` icon instead:

```tsx
import { images, square, triangle } from 'ionicons/icons';
```

Within the tab bar (`<IonTabBar>`), change the label to “Photos” and the `ellipse` icon to `images` for the middle tab button:

```tsx
<IonTabButton tab="tab2" href="/tab2">
  <IonIcon icon={images} />
  <IonLabel>Photos</IonLabel>
</IonTabButton>
```

:::note
In Ionic React, icons are imported individually from `ionicons/icons` and set to the icon prop.
:::

That’s just the start of all the cool things we can do with Ionic. Up next, implement camera taking functionality on the web, then build it for iOS and Android.

Now for the fun part - adding the ability to take photos with the device’s camera using the Capacitor [Camera API](https://capacitorjs.com/docs/apis/camera). We’ll begin with building it for the web, then make some small tweaks to make it work on mobile (iOS and Android).

To do so, we will create our own custom React hook that will manage the photos for the gallery.

:::note
If you are not familiar with React Hooks, [Introducing React Hooks](https://react.dev/reference/react/hooks) from the official React docs is a good resource to start with.
:::

Create a new file at `src/hooks/usePhotoGallery.ts` and open it up.

A custom hook is just a function that uses other React hooks. And that's what we will be doing! We will start by importing the various hooks and utilities we will be using from React core, the Ionic React Hooks project, and Capacitor:

```tsx
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { isPlatform } from '@ionic/react';

import { Camera, CameraResultType, CameraSource, Photo } from '@capacitor/camera';
import { Filesystem, Directory } from '@capacitor/filesystem';
import { Preferences } from '@capacitor/preferences';
import { Capacitor } from '@capacitor/core';
```

Next, create a function named usePhotoGallery:

```tsx
export function usePhotoGallery() {
  const takePhoto = async () => {
    const photo = await Camera.getPhoto({
      resultType: CameraResultType.Uri,
      source: CameraSource.Camera,
      quality: 100,
    });
  };

  return {
    takePhoto,
  };
}
```

Our `usePhotoGallery` hook exposes a method called takePhoto, which in turn calls into Capacitor's getPhoto method.

Notice the magic here: there's no platform-specific code (web, iOS, or Android)! The Capacitor Camera plugin abstracts that away for us, leaving just one method call - `getPhoto()` - that will open up the device's camera and allow us to take photos.

The last step we need to take is to use the new hook from the Tab2 page. Go back to Tab2.tsx and import the hook:

```tsx
import { usePhotoGallery } from '../hooks/usePhotoGallery';
```

And right before the return statement in the functional component, get access to the `takePhoto` method by using the hook:

```tsx
const Tab2: React.FC = () => {
  const { takePhoto } = usePhotoGallery();

  // snip - rest of code
```

Save the file, and if you’re not already, restart the development server in your browser by running `ionic serve`. On the Photo Gallery tab, click the Camera button. If your computer has a webcam of any sort, a modal window appears. Take a selfie!

![A photo gallery app displaying a webcam selfie.](/img/guides/first-app-cap-ng/camera-web.png 'Webcam Selfie in Photo Gallery')

_(Your selfie is probably much better than mine)_

After taking a photo, it disappears. We still need to display it within our app and save it for future access.

## Displaying Photos

First we will create a new type to define our Photo, which will hold specific metadata. Add the following UserPhoto interface to the `usePhotoGallery.ts` file, somewhere outside of the main function:

```tsx
export interface UserPhoto {
  filepath: string;
  webviewPath?: string;
}
```

Back at the top of the function (right after the call to `usePhotoGallery`, we will define a state variable to store the array of each photo captured with the Camera.

```tsx
const [photos, setPhotos] = useState<UserPhoto[]>([]);
```

When the camera is done taking a picture, the resulting Photo returned from Capacitor will be stored in the `photo` variable. We want to create a new photo object and add it to the photos state array. We make sure we don't accidentally mutate the current photos array by making a new array, and then call `setPhotos` to store the array into state. Update the `takePhoto` method and add this code after the getPhoto call:

```tsx
const fileName = Date.now() + '.jpeg';
const newPhotos = [
  {
    filepath: fileName,
    webviewPath: photo.webPath,
  },
  ...photos,
];
setPhotos(newPhotos);
```

Next, let's expose the photos array from our hook. Update the return statement to include the photos:

```tsx
return {
  photos,
  takePhoto,
};
```

And back in the Tab2 component, get access to the photos:

```tsx
const { photos, takePhoto } = usePhotoGallery();
```

With the photo(s) stored into the main array we can display the images on the screen. Add a [Grid component](https://ionicframework.com/docs/api/grid) so that each photo will display nicely as photos are added to the gallery, and loop through each photo in the Photos array, adding an Image component (`<IonImg>`) for each. Point the `src` (source) to the photo’s path:

```tsx
<IonContent>
  <IonGrid>
    <IonRow>
      {photos.map((photo, index) => (
        <IonCol size="6" key={photo.filepath}>
          <IonImg src={photo.webviewPath} />
        </IonCol>
      ))}
    </IonRow>
  </IonGrid>
   <!-- <IonFab> markup  -->
</IonContent>
```

Save all files. Within the web browser, click the Camera button and take another photo. This time, the photo is displayed in the Photo Gallery!

Up next, we’ll add support for saving the photos to the filesystem, so they can be retrieved and displayed in our app at a later time.

-------- ./react/your-first-app/3-saving-photos.md --------

# Saving Photos to the Filesystem

We’re now able to take multiple photos and display them in a photo gallery on the second tab of our app. These photos, however, are not currently being stored permanently, so when the app is closed, they will be lost.

## Filesystem API

Fortunately, saving them to the filesystem only takes a few steps. Begin by opening the `usePhotoGallery` hook (`src/hooks/usePhotoGallery.ts`), and get access to the `writeFile` method from the `Filesystem` class:

:::note
We will use the `writeFile` method initially, but we will use the others coming up shortly, so we'll go ahead and import them now.
:::

Next, create a couple of new functions in `usePhotoGallery`:

```tsx
export function usePhotoGallery() {
  const savePicture = async (photo: Photo, fileName: string): Promise<UserPhoto> => {
    const base64Data = await base64FromPath(photo.webPath!);
    const savedFile = await Filesystem.writeFile({
      path: fileName,
      data: base64Data,
      directory: Directory.Data,
    });

    // Use webPath to display the new image instead of base64 since it's
    // already loaded into memory
    return {
      filepath: fileName,
      webviewPath: photo.webPath,
    };
  };
}

export async function base64FromPath(path: string): Promise<string> {
  const response = await fetch(path);
  const blob = await response.blob();
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    const reader = new FileReader();
    reader.onerror = reject;
    reader.onload = () => {
      if (typeof reader.result === 'string') {
        resolve(reader.result);
      } else {
        reject('method did not return a string');
      }
    };
    reader.readAsDataURL(blob);
  });
}
```

:::note
The base64FromPath method is a helper util that downloads a file from the supplied path and returns a base64 representation of that file.
:::

We pass in the `photo` object, which represents the newly captured device photo, as well as the fileName, which will provide a path for the file to be stored to.

Next we use the Capacitor [Filesystem API](https://capacitorjs.com/docs/apis/filesystem) to save the photo to the filesystem. We start by converting the photo to base64 format, then feed the data to the Filesystem’s `writeFile` function.

Last, call `savePicture` and pass in the photo object and filename directly underneath the call to `setPhotos` in the `takePhoto` method. Here is the full method:

```tsx
const takePhoto = async () => {
  const photo = await Camera.getPhoto({
    resultType: CameraResultType.Uri,
    source: CameraSource.Camera,
    quality: 100,
  });

  const fileName = Date.now() + '.jpeg';
  const savedFileImage = await savePicture(photo, fileName);
  const newPhotos = [savedFileImage, ...photos];
  setPhotos(newPhotos);
};
```

There we go! Each time a new photo is taken, it’s now automatically saved to the filesystem.

  <title>Loading Photos from the Filesystem Using A Key-Value Store</title>
  <meta
    name="description"
    content="We’ve implemented photo taking and saving to the filesystem, now learn how Ionic leverages Capacitor Preferences API for loading our photos in a key-value store."
  />
</head>

We’ve implemented photo taking and saving to the filesystem. There’s one last piece of functionality missing: the photos are stored in the filesystem, but we need a way to save pointers to each file so that they can be displayed again in the photo gallery.

Fortunately, this is easy: we’ll leverage the Capacitor [Preferences API](https://capacitorjs.com/docs/apis/preferences) to store our array of Photos in a key-value store.

## Preferences API

Begin by defining a constant variable that will act as the key for the store before the `usePhotoGallery` function definition in `src/hooks/usePhotoGallery.ts`:

```tsx
const PHOTO_STORAGE = 'photos';
export function usePhotoGallery() {}
```

Then, use the `Storage` class to get access to the get and set methods for reading and writing to device storage:

At the end of the `takePhoto` function, add a call to `Preferences.set()` to save the Photos array. By adding it here, the Photos array is stored each time a new photo is taken. This way, it doesn’t matter when the app user closes or switches to a different app - all photo data is saved.

```tsx
Preferences.set({ key: PHOTO_STORAGE, value: JSON.stringify(newPhotos) });
```

With the photo array data saved, we will create a method that will retrieve the data when the hook loads. We will do so by using React's `useEffect` hook. Insert this above the `takePhoto` declaration. Here is the code, and we will break it down:

```tsx
useEffect(() => {
  const loadSaved = async () => {
    const { value } = await Preferences.get({ key: PHOTO_STORAGE });
    const photosInPreferences = (value ? JSON.parse(value) : []) as UserPhoto[];

    for (let photo of photosInPreferences) {
      const file = await Filesystem.readFile({
        path: photo.filepath,
        directory: Directory.Data,
      });
      // Web platform only: Load the photo as base64 data
      photo.webviewPath = `data:image/jpeg;base64,${file.data}`;
    }
    setPhotos(photosInPreferences);
  };
  loadSaved();
}, []);
```

This seems a bit scary at first, so let's walk through it, first by looking at the second parameter we pass into the hook: the dependency array `[]`.

The useEffect hook, by default, gets called each time a component renders, unless, we pass in a dependency array. In that case, it will only run when a dependency gets updated. In our case we only want it to be called once. By passing in an empty array, which will not be changed, we can prevent the hook from being called multiple times.

The first parameter to `useEffect` is the function that will be called by the effect. We pass in an anonymous arrow function, and inside of it we define another asynchronous method and then immediately call this. We have to call the async function from within the hook as the hook callback can't be asynchronous itself.

On mobile (coming up next!), we can directly set the source of an image tag - `<img src=”x” />` - to each photo file on the Filesystem, displaying them automatically. On the web, however, we must read each image from the Filesystem into base64 format, because the Filesystem API stores them in base64 within [IndexedDB](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API) under the hood.

That’s it! We’ve built a complete Photo Gallery feature in our Ionic app that works on the web. Next up, we’ll transform it into a mobile app for iOS and Android!

-------- ./react/your-first-app/5-adding-mobile.md --------
---
sidebar_label: Adding Mobile

# Adding Mobile

Our photo gallery app won’t be complete until it runs on iOS, Android, and the web - all using one codebase. All it takes is some small logic changes to support mobile platforms, installing some native tooling, then running the app on a device. Let’s go!

Let’s start with making some small code changes - then our app will “just work” when we deploy it to a device.

## Platform-specific Logic

First, we’ll update the photo saving functionality to support mobile. In the `savePicture` function, check which platform the app is running on. If it’s “hybrid” (Capacitor or Cordova, the two native runtimes), then read the photo file into base64 format using the `readFile` method. Also, return the complete file path to the photo using the Filesystem API. When setting the `webviewPath`, use the special `Capacitor.convertFileSrc` method ([details here](https://ionicframework.com/docs/core-concepts/webview#file-protocol)). Otherwise, use the same logic as before when running the app on the web.

```tsx
const savePicture = async (photo: Photo, fileName: string): Promise<UserPhoto> => {
  let base64Data: string | Blob;
  // "hybrid" will detect Cordova or Capacitor;
  if (isPlatform('hybrid')) {
    const file = await Filesystem.readFile({
      path: photo.path!,
    });
    base64Data = file.data;
  } else {
    base64Data = await base64FromPath(photo.webPath!);
  }
  const savedFile = await Filesystem.writeFile({
    path: fileName,
    data: base64Data,
    directory: Directory.Data,
  });

  if (isPlatform('hybrid')) {
    // Display the new image by rewriting the 'file://' path to HTTP
    // Details: https://ionicframework.com/docs/building/webview#file-protocol
    return {
      filepath: savedFile.uri,
      webviewPath: Capacitor.convertFileSrc(savedFile.uri),
    };
  } else {
    // Use webPath to display the new image instead of base64 since it's
    // already loaded into memory
    return {
      filepath: fileName,
      webviewPath: photo.webPath,
    };
  }
};
```

Next, add a new bit of logic in the `loadSaved` function. On mobile, we can directly point to each photo file on the Filesystem and display them automatically. On the web, however, we must read each image from the Filesystem into base64 format. This is because the Filesystem API uses [IndexedDB](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API) under the hood. Update the `loadSaved` function inside of `useEffect` to:

```tsx
const loadSaved = async () => {
  const { value } = await Preferences.get({ key: PHOTO_STORAGE });

  const photosInPreferences = (value ? JSON.parse(value) : []) as UserPhoto[];
  // If running on the web...
  if (!isPlatform('hybrid')) {
    for (let photo of photosInPreferences) {
      const file = await Filesystem.readFile({
        path: photo.filepath,
        directory: Directory.Data,
      });
      // Web platform only: Load the photo as base64 data
      photo.webviewPath = `data:image/jpeg;base64,${file.data}`;
    }
  }
  setPhotos(photosInPreferences);
};
```

Our Photo Gallery now consists of one codebase that runs on the web, Android, and iOS. Next up, the part you’ve been waiting for - deploying the app to a device.

# Deploying to iOS and Android

Since we added Capacitor to our project when it was first created, there’s only a handful of steps remaining until the Photo Gallery app is on our device! Remember, you can find the complete source code for this app [here](https://github.com/ionic-team/photo-gallery-capacitor-react).

## Capacitor Setup

Capacitor is Ionic’s official app runtime that makes it easy to deploy web apps to native platforms like iOS, Android, and more. If you’ve used Cordova in the past, consider reading more about the differences [here](https://capacitorjs.com/docs/cordova#differences-between-capacitor-and-cordova).

If you’re still running `ionic serve` in the terminal, cancel it. Complete a fresh build of the Ionic project, fixing any errors that it reports:

```shell
ionic build
```

Next, create both the iOS and Android projects:

```shell
$ ionic cap add ios
$ ionic cap add android
```

Both android and ios folders at the root of the project are created. These are entirely standalone native projects that should be considered part of your Ionic app (i.e., check them into source control, edit them using their native tooling, etc.).

Every time you perform a build (e.g. `ionic build`) that updates your web directory (default: `build`), you'll need to copy those changes into your native projects:

```shell
ionic cap copy
```

Note: After making updates to the native portion of the code (such as adding a new plugin), use the `sync` command:

```shell
ionic cap sync
```

## iOS

:::note
To build an iOS app, you’ll need a Mac computer.
:::

Capacitor iOS apps are configured and managed through Xcode (Apple’s iOS/Mac IDE), with dependencies managed by CocoaPods. Before running this app on an iOS device, there's a couple of steps to complete.

First, run the Capacitor `open` command, which opens the native iOS project in Xcode:

```shell
ionic cap open ios
```

In order for some native plugins to work, user permissions must be configured. In our photo gallery app, this includes the Camera plugin: iOS displays a modal dialog automatically after the first time that `Camera.getPhoto()` is called, prompting the user to allow the app to use the Camera. The permission that drives this is labeled “Privacy - Camera Usage.” To set it, the `Info.plist` file must be modified ([more details here](https://capacitorjs.com/docs/ios/configuration)). To access it, click "Info," then expand "Custom iOS Target Properties."

![The Info.plist file in Xcode showing the NSCameraUsageDescription key added for camera access.](/img/guides/first-app-cap-ng/xcode-info-plist.png 'Xcode Info.plist Configuration')

Each setting in `Info.plist` has a low-level parameter name and a high-level name. By default, the property list editor shows the high-level names, but it's often useful to switch to showing the raw, low-level names. To do this, right-click anywhere in the property list editor and toggle "Raw Keys/Values."

Add the `NSCameraUsageDescription` Key and set the Value to something that describes why the app needs to use the camera, such as "To Take Photos." The Value field is displayed to the app user when the permission prompt opens.

Follow the same process to add the other two Keys required of the Camera plugin: `NSPhotoLibraryAddUsageDescription` and `NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription`.

Next, click on `App` in the Project Navigator on the left-hand side, then within the `Signing & Capabilities` section, select your Development Team.

![The Xcode interface displaying the Signing and Capabilities tab for an iOS app project.](/img/guides/first-app-cap-ng/xcode-signing.png 'Xcode Signing & Capabilities')

With permissions in place and Development Team selected, we are ready to try out the app on a real device! Connect an iOS device to your Mac computer, select it (`App -> Matthew’s iPhone` for me) then click the "Build" button to build, install, and launch the app on your device:

![Xcode toolbar highlighting the Build button used to compile and run an iOS app.](/img/guides/first-app-cap-ng/xcode-build-button.png 'Xcode Build Button')

Upon tapping the Camera button on the Photo Gallery tab, the permission prompt will display. Tap OK, then take a picture with the Camera. Afterward, the photo shows in the app!

![Two iPhones side by side, one showing the camera permission prompt and the other displaying a photo taken with the app.](/img/guides/first-app-cap-ng/ios-permissions-photo.png 'iOS Camera Permission Prompt and Photo Result')

## Android

Capacitor Android apps are configured and managed through Android Studio. Before running this app on an Android device, there's a couple of steps to complete.

First, run the Capacitor `open` command, which opens the native Android project in Android Studio:

```shell
ionic cap open android
```

Similar to iOS, we must enable the correct permissions to use the Camera. Configure these in the `AndroidManifest.xml` file. Android Studio will likely open this file automatically, but in case it doesn't, locate it under `android/app/src/main/`.

![Android Studio editor showing the AndroidManifest.xml file with camera permissions.](/img/guides/first-app-cap-ng/android-manifest.png 'Android Manifest Permissions')

Scroll to the `Permissions` section and ensure these entries are included:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />
```

Save the file. With permissions in place, we are ready to try out the app on a real device! Connect an Android device to your computer. Within Android Studio, click the "Run" button, select the attached Android device, then click OK to build, install, and launch the app on your device.

![The Android Studio interface with arrows pointing to the Run button and the connected device.](/img/guides/first-app-cap-ng/android-device.png 'Android Studio Run Configuration')

Once again, upon tapping the Camera button on the Photo Gallery tab, the permission prompt should be displayed. Tap OK, then take a picture with the Camera. Afterward, the photo should appear in the app.

![Two Android phones side by side, one showing the camera permission prompt and the other displaying a photo taken with the app.](/img/guides/first-app-cap-ng/android-permissions-photo.png 'Android Permissions and Photo Capture')

Our Photo Gallery app has just been deployed to Android and iOS devices. 🎉

In the final portion of this tutorial, we’ll use the Ionic CLI’s Live Reload functionality to quickly implement photo deletion - thus completing our Photo Gallery feature.

-------- ./react/your-first-app/7-live-reload.md --------

sidebar_label: Live Reload

# Rapid App Development with Live Reload

So far, we’ve seen how easy it is to develop a cross-platform app that works everywhere. The development experience is pretty quick, but what if I told you there was a way to go faster?

We can use the Ionic CLI’s [Live Reload functionality](https://ionicframework.com/docs/cli/livereload) to boost our productivity when building Ionic apps. When active, Live Reload will reload the browser and/or WebView when changes in the app are detected.

## Live Reload

Remember `ionic serve`? That was Live Reload working in the browser, allowing us to iterate quickly.

We can also use it when developing on iOS and Android devices. This is particularly useful when writing code that interacts with native plugins. Since we need to run native plugin code on a device in order to verify that it works, having a way to quickly write code, build and deploy it, then test it is crucial to keeping up our development speed.

Let’s use Live Reload to implement photo deletion, the missing piece of our Photo Gallery feature. Select your platform of choice (iOS or Android) and connect a device to your computer. Next, run either command in a terminal, based on your chosen platform:

```shell
$ ionic cap run ios -l --external

$ ionic cap run android -l --external
```

The Live Reload server will start up, and the native IDE of choice will open if not opened already. Within the IDE, click the Play button to launch the app onto your device.

## Deleting Photos

With Live Reload running and the app open on your device, let’s implement photo deletion functionality. In your code editor (not Android Studio or Xcode), open `Tab2.tsx` then import `useState` from React and `UserPhoto` from the `usePhotoGallery` hook:

```tsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { usePhotoGallery, UserPhoto } from '../hooks/usePhotoGallery';
// other imports
```

Next, reference the `deletePhoto` function, which we'll create soon:

```tsx
const { photos, takePhoto, deletePhoto } = usePhotoGallery();
```

Next, add a state value to store information about the photo to delete:

```tsx
const [photoToDelete, setPhotoToDelete] = useState<UserPhoto>();
```

When a user clicks on an image, we will show the action sheet by changing the state value to the photo. Update the `<IonImg>` element to:

```tsx
<IonImg onClick={() => setPhotoToDelete(photo)} src={photo.webviewPath} />
```

Next, add an [IonActionSheet](https://ionicframework.com/docs/api/action-sheet) dialog with the option to either delete the selected photo or cancel (close) the dialog. We will set the isOpen property based on if photoToDelete has a value or not.

In the JSX, put the following component before the closing `</IonContent>` tag.

```tsx
<IonActionSheet
  isOpen={!!photoToDelete}
  buttons={[
    {
      text: 'Delete',
      role: 'destructive',
      icon: trash,
      handler: () => {
        if (photoToDelete) {
          deletePhoto(photoToDelete);
          setPhotoToDelete(undefined);
        }
      },
    },
    {
      text: 'Cancel',
      icon: close,
      role: 'cancel',
    },
  ]}
  onDidDismiss={() => setPhotoToDelete(undefined)}
/>
```

Above, we added two options: `Delete` that calls `deletePhoto` function (to be added next) and `Cancel`, which when given the role of “cancel” will automatically close the action sheet. It's also important to set the onDidDismiss function and set our photoToDelete back to undefined when the modal goes away. That way, when another image is clicked, the action sheet notices the change in the value of photoToDelete.

Next, we need to implement the deletePhoto method that will come from the `usePhotoGallery` hook. Open the file and paste in the following function in the hook:

```tsx
const deletePhoto = async (photo: UserPhoto) => {
  // Remove this photo from the Photos reference data array
  const newPhotos = photos.filter((p) => p.filepath !== photo.filepath);

  // Update photos array cache by overwriting the existing photo array
  Preferences.set({ key: PHOTO_STORAGE, value: JSON.stringify(newPhotos) });

  // delete photo file from filesystem
  const filename = photo.filepath.substring(photo.filepath.lastIndexOf('/') + 1);
  await Filesystem.deleteFile({
    path: filename,
    directory: Directory.Data,
  });
  setPhotos(newPhotos);
};
```

The selected photo is removed from the Photos array first. Then, we use the Capacitor Preferences API to update the cached version of the Photos array. Finally, we delete the actual photo file itself using the Filesystem API.

Make sure to return the `deletePhoto` function so it is as a part of the hook API that we expose:

```tsx
return {
  photos,
  takePhoto,
  deletePhoto,
};
```

Save this file, then tap on a photo again and choose the “Delete” option. This time, the photo is deleted! Implemented much faster using Live Reload. 💪

In the final portion of this tutorial, we’ll walk you through the basics of the Appflow product used to build and deploy your application to users' devices.

# Build and Deploy your App

Now that you have built your first app, you are going to want to get it distributed so everyone can start using it. The mechanics of building and deploying your application can be quite cumbersome. That is where [Appflow](https://ionic.io/docs/appflow/) comes into play. Appflow allows you to effectively generate web and native builds, push out live app updates, publish your app to the app stores, and automate the whole process. The entire Quickstart guide can be found [here](https://ionic.io/docs/appflow/quickstart).

Below we will run through an overview of the steps.

## Connect Your Repo

Appflow works directly with Git version control and uses your existing code base as the source of truth for Deploy and Package builds. You will first need to integrate with your hosting service, such as GitHub or Bitbucket, or you can push your code directly to Appflow. Once this is completed, Appflow will have access to your code.

For more on connecting your code repository to Appflow, checkout the [Connect your Repo](https://ionic.io/docs/appflow/quickstart/connect) section inside the Appflow docs.

## Install the Appflow SDK

The Appflow SDK (also known as Ionic Deploy plugin) will allow you to take advantage of arguably two of the best Appflow features: deploying live updates to your app and bypassing the app stores. Ionic Appflow's Live Update feature is shipped with Appflow SDK and features the capabilities of detecting and syncing the updates for your app that you have pushed to your identified channels within the dashboard.

To get the Appflow SDK plugin added to your project, you can follow the install instructions within the Appflow Dashboard by clicking on "Install Instructions" inside of the `Deploy > Destinations` section. Alternatively, you can install the plugin manually by executing the following command in your app's root directory:

```shell
ionic deploy add  \
    --app-id="YOUR_APP_ID" \
    --channel-name="YOUR_CHANNEL_NAME" \
    --update-method="background|auto|none" \
```

For prerequisite and additional instructions on installing the Appflow SDK, visit the [Install the Appflow SDK](https://ionic.io/docs/appflow/quickstart/installation) section inside the Appflow docs.

## Push a Commit

In order for Appflow to access the latest and greatest changes to your code, you will need to push a commit via the version control integration of your choosing. For those that use GitHub or Bitbucket, this would look as follows:

```shell
git add . # stage any changes
git commit -m "added appflow sdk" #  commit staged changes
git push origin main # push the changes from the main branch to your git host
```

After the push is made, you will then see your commit under the `Commits` tab of the Appflow Dashboard. For more on this, take a look at the [Push a Commit](https://ionic.io/docs/appflow/quickstart/push) section inside the Appflow docs.

## Deploy a Live Update

With the Appflow SDK installed and your commit pushed up to the Dashboard, you are ready to deploy a live update to a device. The Live Update feature uses the installed Appflow SDK with your native application to listen to a particular Deploy Channel Destination. When a live update is assigned to a Channel Destination, that update will be deployed to user devices running binaries that are configured to listen to that specific Channel Destination.

To get the live update deployed, a Web build will need to be created. This can be done through the `Start build` icon from the `Commits` tab or by clicking the `New build` button in the top right corner of the `Build > Builds` tab. After selecting the correct commit to deploy, select the `Web` target platform and the `Latest` build stack. Depending on your Appflow plan, you will then be able to include custom environments, if any are configured. Finally, you can enable `Live Update` and pick the Channel to automatically assign the build to once it successfully completes.

Upon completion of the Web Build, additional versioning options are available to you. After completing this section and you have a successful Deploy build, you can then assign it to the same Channel you configured the Appflow SDK to listen to when you installed it by clicking the `Deploy live updates` button in the build detail page. The same can be done by clicking the `Deploy live updates` icon on the build in the `Build > Builds` tab and select the Channel from the dropdown.

To receive this live update, you will need to run the app on a device or an emulator. The quickest and easiest way to do this is through the following command:

```shell
ionic cordova run [ios | android] [options]
```

Assuming the app is configured correctly to listen to the channel you deployed to, the app should immediately update on startup if you have chosen the auto update method during setup. If the background update method was chosen, be sure to stay in the app for about 30 seconds to ensure the update was downloaded. Then, close the application, reopen it, and you will see the updates applied!

To dive into more details on the steps to deploy a live update, as well as additional information such as disabling deploy for development, check out the [Deploy a Live Update](https://ionic.io/docs/appflow/quickstart/deploy) section inside the Appflow docs.

## Build a Native Binary

Next up is a native binary for your app build and deploy process. This is done via the [Ionic Package](https://ionic.io/docs/appflow/package/intro) service. First things first, you will need to create a [Package build](https://ionic.io/docs/appflow/package/builds). This can be done by clicking the `Start build` icon from the `Commits` tab or by clicking the `New build` button in the top right from the `Build > Builds` tab. Then you will select the proper commit for your build and fill in all of the several required fields and any optional fields that you want to specify. After filling in all of the information and the build begins, you can check out it's progress and review the logs if you encounter any errors.

Given a successful Package build, and iOS binary (`.ipa` or IPA) or and Android binary (`.apk` or APK) file becomes available to you. The file can subsequently be downloaded so you can install it on a device by clicking the file name in the `Artifacts` section in the right of the build detail page or clicking the `Download IPA/APK` icon on the build in the `Build > Builds` tab.

Further information regarding building native binaries can be found inside of the [Build a Native Binary](https://ionic.io/docs/appflow/quickstart/package) section inside the Appflow docs.

## Create an Automation

[Automations](https://ionic.io/docs/appflow/automation/intro) enable you and your team to utilize the full CI/CD powers of Appflow. You can create automations that trigger [Package builds](https://ionic.io/docs/appflow/package/builds) and [Deploy builds](https://ionic.io/docs/appflow/deploy/builds) every time your team commits new code to a given branch. The automations can also be configured to use different environments and native configurations for building different versions of your app for development, staging, QA and production.

For more information, visit the [Create an Automation](https://ionic.io/docs/appflow/quickstart/automation) section within the Appflow docs. There you will see details on creating a single automation. However, you can create multiple automations for different branches or workflows and customize them to fit your needs. An important note is that the ability to create an automation is available for those on our [Basic plans](https://ionic.io/pricing) and above.

## Create an Environment

[Package builds](https://ionic.io/docs/appflow/package/builds) and [Deploy builds](https://ionic.io/docs/appflow/deploy/builds) can be further customized via [Environments](https://ionic.io/docs/appflow/automation/environments). This powerful feature allows you to create different configurations based on the environment variables passed in at build time. When combined with the [Automation](https://ionic.io/docs/appflow/automation/intro) feature, development teams can easily configure development, staging, and production build configurations, allowing them to embrace DevOps best practices and ship better quality updates faster than ever.

Creating an Environment is available for those on our [Basic plans](https://ionic.io/pricing) and above. More information on this can be found in the [Create an Environment](https://ionic.io/docs/appflow/quickstart/environment) section within the Appflow docs.

## Create a Native Configuration

[Native Configurations](https://ionic.io/docs/appflow/package/native-configs) allow you to easily modify common configuration values that can change between different environments (development, production, staging, etc.) so you do not need to use extra logic or manually commit them to version control. Native configurations can be attached to any [Package build](https://ionic.io/docs/appflow/package/intro) or [Automation](https://ionic.io/docs/appflow/automation/intro).

Native configs can be used to:

- Overwrite the unique bundle identifier or [id attribute](https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/config_ref/#widget) in `config.xml`
- Overwrite the App Name as it will appear on the home screen of a device
- Overwrite the [Appflow SDK (Deploy Plugin) variables and preferences](https://ionic.io/docs/appflow/deploy/api#plugin-variables)

For access to the ability to create a Native Configuration, you will need to be on our [Basic plans](https://ionic.io/pricing) and above. Additional details of this feature can be found in the [Create a Native Configuration](https://ionic.io/docs/appflow/quickstart/native-config) section within the Appflow docs.

## What’s Next?

Congratulations! You developed a complete cross-platform Photo Gallery app that runs on the web, iOS, and Android. Not only that, you have also then built the app and deployed it to you users devices!

There are many paths to follow from here. Try adding another [Ionic UI component](https://ionicframework.com/docs/components) to the app, or more [native functionality](https://capacitorjs.com/docs/apis). The sky’s the limit. Once you have added another feature run the build and deploy process again through Appflow to get it out to your users.

Happy app building! 💙

  <title>Mobile Browser Support to Run Ionic Apps Anywhere</title>
  <meta
    name="description"
    content="Due to a foundation in web technologies, Ionic mobile apps can run anywhere the web runs — iOS, Android, browsers, PWAs, and more. Learn about browser support."
  />
</head>

Ionic's earliest goal was to make it easy to develop mobile apps using web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Because of this foundation in web technologies, Ionic can run anywhere the web runs — iOS, Android, browsers, PWAs, and more.

## Mobile Platforms

In pursuit of [adaptive styling](../core-concepts/fundamentals.md#adaptive-styling), Ionic fully supports and is well tested on the mobile platforms listed below:

| Framework |        Android         |  iOS  |
| :-------: | :--------------------: | :---: |
| Ionic v8  | 5.1+ with Chromium 89+ | 15.0+ |
| Ionic v7  | 5.1+ with Chromium 79+ | 14.0+ |
| Ionic v6  | 5.0+ with Chromium 60+ | 13.0+ |
| Ionic v5  |          5.0+          | 11.0+ |
| Ionic v4  |          4.4+          | 10.0+ |

:::note
Check the [latest Android stats](https://developer.android.com/about/dashboards/) and the [latest iOS stats](https://developer.apple.com/support/app-store/) for up-to-date platform information.
:::

### A Note on Android Support

Starting with Android 5.0, the webview was moved to a separate application that can be updated independently of Android. This means that most Android 5.0+ devices are going to be running a modern version of Chromium. However, there are a still a subset of Android devices that are unable to have their webview updated. These webviews are typically stuck at the version that was available when the device initially shipped.

To figure out what version of the webview a device is running, log `window.navigator.userAgent` to the console when inspecting the application using Chrome Dev Tools.

## Browsers

Ionic supports the following browsers:

|   Browser   | Ionic v8 | Ionic v7 | Ionic v6 | Ionic v5 | Ionic v4 |
| :---------: | :------: | :------: | :------: | :------: | :------: |
| **Chrome**  |   89+    |   79+    |   60+    |    ✔     |    ✔     |
| **Safari**  |   15+    |   14+    |   13+    |    ✔     |    ✔     |
|  **Edge**   |   89+    |   79+    |   79+    |   79+    |    ✔     |
| **Firefox** |   75+    |   70+    |   63+    |    ✔     |    ✔     |
|  **IE 11**  |  **X**   |  **X**   |  **X**   |  **X**   |  **X**   |

    <em>transpilation</em> in Ionic Framework is converting <a href="#es2015-es6">ES2015/ES6</a>
    (<a href="#typescript">TypeScript</a>) to <a href="#es5">ES5</a> (traditional JavaScript).

## Community Maintenance

The Ionic Framework has been 100% open source (MIT) since the very beginning, and always will be. Developers can ensure Ionic is the right choice for their cross-platform apps through Ionic’s community maintenance strategy. The Ionic team regularly ships new releases, bug fixes, and is very welcoming to community pull requests.

## Framework Maintenance and Support Status

Given the reality of time and resource constraints as well as the desire to keep innovating in the frontend development space, over time it becomes necessary for the Ionic team to shift focus to newer versions of the Framework. However, Ionic will do everything it can to make the transition to newer versions as smooth as possible. The Ionic team recommends updating to the newest version of the Ionic Framework for the latest features, improvements and stability updates.

The current status of each Ionic Framework version is:

| Version |     Status     |   Released   | Maintenance Ends | Ext. Support Ends |
| :-----: | :------------: | :----------: | :--------------: | :---------------: |
|   V8    |   **Active**   | Apr 17, 2024 |       TBD        |        TBD        |
|   V7    | End of Support | Mar 29, 2023 |   Oct 17, 2024   |   Apr 17, 2025    |
|   V6    | End of Support | Dec 8, 2021  |   Sep 29, 2023   |   Mar 29, 2024    |
|   V5    | End of Support | Feb 11, 2020 |   June 8, 2022   |    Dec 8, 2022    |
|   V4    | End of Support | Jan 23, 2019 |   Aug 11, 2020   |   Sept 30, 2022   |
|   V3    | End of Support | Apr 5, 2017  |   Oct 30, 2019   |   Aug 11, 2020    |
|   V2    | End of Support | Jan 25, 2017 |   Apr 5, 2017    |    Apr 5, 2017    |
|   V1    | End of Support | May 12, 2015 |   Jan 25, 2017   |   Jan 25, 2017    |

- **Maintenance**: Only critical bug and security fixes. No major feature improvements.
- **Extended Support**: For teams and organizations that require additional long term maintenance support, Ionic has extended support options available. To learn more, see our [Enterprise offerings](https://ionicframework.com/enterprise).

## Compatibility Recommendations

The Ionic team has compiled a set of recommendations for using the Ionic Framework in conjunction with other contextually-relevant software. This is not meant to be a comprehensive list, but covers many common compatibility questions. The Ionic team strongly recommends reviewing your project dependencies once each quarter to keep track of new releases, features and bug fixes.

### Core Dependencies

#### Ionic Angular

| Framework | Minimum Angular Version | Maximum Angular Version | TypeScript |
| :-------: | :---------------------: | :---------------------: | :--------: |
|    v8     |           v16           |        v20.x[^3]        |   4.9.3+   |
|    v7     |           v14           |        v17.x[^2]        |    4.6+    |
|    v6     |           v12           |        v15.x[^1]        |    4.0+    |
|    v5     |          v8.2           |          v12.x          |    3.5+    |
|    v4     |          v8.2           |          v11.x          |    3.5+    |
|    v3     |         v5.2.11         |         v5.2.11         |   2.6.2    |

[^1]: Angular 14.x supported starting in Ionic v6.1.9. Angular 15.x supported starting in Ionic v6.3.6.
[^2]: Angular 17.x supported starting in Ionic v7.5.4.
[^3]: Angular 18.x supported starting in Ionic v8.2.0.

**Angular 13+ Support On Older Versions of iOS**

Angular's support policy for iOS is the two most recent major versions. This means that changes to your Angular project may be necessary to use Ionic Angular v4-v6 on iOS 13. To support iOS 13, change the project `target` specified in `compilerOptions` in the tsconfig.json to `es5`. Without this change an error of `Unexpected token '.' in promiseReactionJob` will occur on app startup in iOS 13.

Note that later versions of Ionic do not support iOS 13; see [mobile support table here](./browser-support#mobile-browsers).

#### Ionic React

| Framework | Required React Version | TypeScript |
| :-------: | :--------------------: | :--------: |
|    v8     |          v17+          |    3.7+    |
|    v7     |          v17+          |    3.7+    |
|    v6     |          v17+          |    3.7+    |
|    v5     |         v16.8+         |    3.7+    |
|    v4     |         v16.8+         |    3.7+    |

#### Ionic Vue

| Framework | Required Vue Version | TypeScript |
| :-------: | :------------------: | :--------: |
|    v8     |       v3.0.6+        |    3.9+    |
|    v7     |       v3.0.6+        |    3.9+    |
|    v6     |       v3.0.6+        |    3.9+    |
|    v5     |        v3.0+         |    3.9+    |

-------- ./reference/versioning.md --------
# Versioning

<!-- TOC goes here -->

Ionic Framework follows the <a href="https://semver.org/" target="_blank">Semantic Versioning (SemVer)</a> convention: <code>major.minor.patch.</code> Incompatible API changes increment the <code>major</code> version, adding backwards-compatible functionality increments the <code>minor</code> version, and backwards-compatible bug fixes increment the <code>patch</code> version.

## Release Schedule

### Major Release

A major release will be published when there is a breaking change introduced in the API. Major releases will occur roughly every **6 months** and may contain breaking changes. Several release candidates will be published prior to a major release in order to get feedback before the final release. An outline of what is changing and why will be included with the release candidates.

### Minor Release

A minor release will be published when a new feature is added or API changes that are non-breaking are introduced. We will heavily test any changes so that we are confident with the release, but with new code comes the potential for new issues. We are scheduled to release a minor version **every 4 weeks**, if any features or API changes were made.

### Patch Release

A patch release will be published when bug fixes were included, but the API has not changed and no breaking changes were introduced. We are scheduled to release a new patch version **every week**, but there may be times where we need to release sooner or later than scheduled. To ensure patch releases can fix existing code without introducing new issues from the new features, patch releases will always be published prior to a minor release.

## Changelog

To see a list of all notable changes to Ionic please refer to the <a href="https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md" target="_blank">changelog</a>. This contains an ordered
list of all bug fixes and new features under each release.

  />
</head>

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

## Sanitizing User Input

For components such as `ion-alert` developers can allow for custom or user-provided content. This content can be plain text or HTML and should be considered untrusted. As with any untrusted input, it is important to sanitize it before doing anything else with it. In particular, using things like `innerHTML` without sanitization provides an attack vector for bad actors to input malicious content and potentially launch a [Cross Site Scripting attack (XSS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting).

Ionic comes built in with a basic sanitization implementation for the components it provides. However, it is not a comprehensive solution. It is up to the developer to make sure all data that is passed is sanitized. Different frameworks have different solutions for sanitizing user input, so developers should familiarize themselves with what their specific framework offers.

For developers who are not using a framework, or for developers whose framework does not provide the sanitization methods they need, we recommend using [sanitize-html](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sanitize-html). This package provides a simple HTML sanitizer that allows the developer to specify the exact tags and attributes that they want to allow in their application.

### Angular

Angular comes built in with the `DomSanitizer` class. This helps prevent XSS issues by ensuring that values are safe to be used in the DOM. By default, Angular will mark any values it deems unsafe. For example, the following link would be marked as unsafe by Angular because it would attempt to execute some JavaScript.

```tsx
public myUrl: string = 'javascript:alert("oh no!")';

...

<a [href]="myUrl">Click Me!</a>
```

To learn more about the built-in protections that Angular provides, see the [Angular Security Guide](https://angular.io/guide/security).

### React

React DOM escapes values embedded in JSX before rendering them by converting them to strings. For example, the following would be safe as `name` is converted to a string before being rendered:

```jsx
const name = values.name;
const element = <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>;
```

However, this does not stop someone from injecting JavaScript into places such as the `href` attribute of an anchor element. The following is unsafe and can potentially allow an XSS attack to occur:

```jsx
const userInput = 'javascript:alert("Oh no!")';
const element = <a href={userInput}>Click Me!</a>;
```

If the developer needs to achieve more comprehensive sanitization, they can use the [sanitize-html](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sanitize-html) package.

### Vue

Vue does not provide any type of sanitizing methods built in. It is recommended that developers use a package such as [sanitize-html](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sanitize-html).

To learn more about the security recommendations for binding to directives such as `v-html`, see the [Vue Syntax Guide](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/syntax.html#Raw-HTML).

## Enabling Custom HTML Parsing via `innerHTML`

`ion-alert`, `ion-infinite-scroll-content`, `ion-loading`, `ion-refresher-content`, and `ion-toast` can accept custom HTML as strings for certain properties. These strings are added to the DOM using `innerHTML` and must be properly sanitized by the developer. This behavior is disabled by default which means values passed to the affected components will always be interpreted as plaintext. Developers can enable this custom HTML behavior by setting `innerHTMLTemplatesEnabled: true` in the [IonicConfig](../developing/config#ionicconfig).

## Ejecting from the built-in sanitizer

For developers who wish to add complex HTML to components such as `ion-toast`, they will need to eject from the sanitizer that is built into Ionic Framework. Developers can either disable the sanitizer across their entire app or bypass it on a case-by-case basis.

:::note
Bypassing sanitization functionality can make your application vulnerable to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">XSS attacks</a>. Please exercise extreme caution when disabling the sanitizer.
:::

### Disabling the sanitizer via config

Ionic Framework provides an application config option called `sanitizerEnabled` that is set to `true` by default. Set this value to `false` to globally disable Ionic Framework's built in sanitizer. Please note that this does not disable any sanitizing functionality provided by other frameworks such as Angular.

### Bypassing the sanitizer on a case-by-case basis

Developers can also choose to eject from the sanitizer in certain scenarios. Ionic Framework provides the `IonicSafeString` class that allows developers to do just that.

:::note
In order to bypass the sanitizer and use unsanitized custom HTML in the relevant Ionic components, `innerHTMLTemplatesEnabled` must be set to `true` in the Ionic config.

`IonicSafeString` should not be used if `innerHTMLTemplatesEnabled` is set to `false`.

See [Enabling Custom HTML Parsing](#enabling-custom-html-parsing-via-innerhtml) for more information.

## Content Security Policies (CSP)

A [Content Security Policy (CSP)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP) is a security mechanism that helps protect web applications against certain types of attacks, such as cross-site scripting (XSS) and data injection. It is implemented through an HTTP header that instructs the browser on which sources of content, such as scripts, stylesheets, and images, are allowed to be loaded and executed on a web page.

The main purpose of a CSP is to mitigate the risks associated with code injection attacks. By defining a policy, web developers can specify from which domains or sources the browser should allow the loading and execution of various types of content. This effectively limits the potential damage that can be caused by malicious scripts or unauthorized content.

### Enabling CSPs

Developers can assign a CSP to their application by setting a meta tag with the policy details and the expected nonce value on script and style tags.

```html
<meta
  http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy"
  content="default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'nonce-randomNonceGoesHere'; style-src 'self' 'nonce-randomNonceGoesHere';"
/>
```

### Ionic and CSP

Ionic Framework provides a function to help developers set the nonce value used when constructing the web component stylesheets. This function should be called before any Ionic components are loaded. This is required to pass the nonce value to the web components so that they can be used in a CSP environment.

```ts
import { setNonce } from '@ionic/core/loader';

setNonce('randomNonceGoesHere');
```

:::tip

In Angular this can be called in the `main.ts` file, before the application is bootstrapped.

:::

For more information on how to use CSPs with Stencil web components, see the [Stencil documentation](https://stenciljs.com/docs/csp-nonce).

### Angular

Starting in Angular 16, Angular provides two options for setting the nonce value.

1. Set the `ngCspNonce` attribute on the root application element as `<app ngCspNonce="randomNonceGoesHere"></app>`. Use this approach if you have access to server-side templating that can add the nonce both to the header and the `index.html` when constructing the response.
2. Provide the nonce using the [`CSP_NONCE`](https://angular.io/api/core/CSP_NONCE) injection token. Use this approach if you have access to the nonce at runtime and you want to be able to cache the `index.html`.

:::tip

If providing the `CSP_NONCE` injection token, set the provider in your `AppModule` for module projects or within the `bootstrapApplication` for standalone projects.

:::

For more information on how to use CSPs with Angular, see the [Angular documentation](https://angular.io/guide/security#content-security-policy).

CSS-based theming enables apps to customize the colors quickly by loading a CSS file or changing a few CSS property values.

## `theme-color` Meta

The `theme-color` value for a meta tag indicates a color that browsers can use to customize the display of a page or of the surrounding interface. This kind of meta tag can also accept media queries which allow developers to set the theme color for both light and dark modes.

The `content` value for the `theme-color` meta must contain a valid <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CSS Color</a> and cannot contain CSS Variables.

:::note
The `theme-color` meta controls the interface theme when running in a web browser or as a PWA and has no effect when an app is deployed using Capacitor or Cordova. If you are looking to customize the area under the status bar, we recommend using the [Capacitor Status Bar Plugin](https://capacitorjs.com/docs/apis/status-bar).
:::

The example below demonstrates how to use `theme-color` to style the browser interface on iOS 15.

```html
<meta name="theme-color" media="(prefers-color-scheme: light)" content="#0054e9" />
<meta name="theme-color" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" content="#eb445a" />
```

| Light Mode                                                                                                         | Dark Mode                                                                                                       |

The `theme-color` meta can also be used to customize the toolbar in Safari on macOS Monterey or newer.

Safari on iOS 15 and macOS will automatically determine an appropriate theme color to use, but adding this meta tag is useful if you need more control over the theme.

There is a small subset of colors that browsers will not use as they interfere with the browser interface. For example, setting `content="red"` will not work in Safari on macOS because that color interferes with the red close button in the toolbar. If you run into this situation, try altering your color selection slightly.

:::note
Browsers will prefer the `theme-color` meta over `theme` in `manifest.json` if both are present.

## Global Variables

While the application and stepped variables in the themes section are useful for changing the colors of an application, often times there is a need for variables that are used in multiple components. The following variables are shared across components to change global padding settings and more.

### Application Variables

| Name                        | Description                                                                                          |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--ion-font-family`         | Font family of the app                                                                               |
| `--ion-statusbar-padding`   | Statusbar padding top of the app                                                                     |
| `--ion-safe-area-top`       | Adjust the safe area inset top of the app                                                            |
| `--ion-safe-area-right`     | Adjust the safe area inset right of the app                                                          |
| `--ion-safe-area-bottom`    | Adjust the safe area inset bottom of the app                                                         |
| `--ion-safe-area-left`      | Adjust the safe area inset left of the app                                                           |
| `--ion-margin`              | Adjust the margin of the [Margin attributes](../layout/css-utilities.md#element-margin)              |
| `--ion-padding`             | Adjust the padding of the [Padding attributes](../layout/css-utilities.md#element-padding)           |
| `--ion-placeholder-opacity` | Adjust the opacity of the placeholders used in the input, textarea, searchbar, and select components |

### Grid Variables

| Name                           | Description                                    |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `--ion-grid-columns`           | Number of columns in the grid                  |
| `--ion-grid-padding-xs`        | Padding of the grid for xs breakpoints         |
| `--ion-grid-padding-sm`        | Padding of the grid for sm breakpoints         |
| `--ion-grid-padding-md`        | Padding of the grid for md breakpoints         |

| `--ion-grid-column-padding-xl` | Padding of the grid columns for xl breakpoints |

## Known Limitations with Variables

### The Alpha Problem

There is not yet full <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value#Browser_compatibility" target="_blank">browser support</a> for alpha use of a hex color. The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value#rgb()_and_rgba()" target="_blank">`rgba()`</a> function only accepts a value in `R, G, B, A` (Red, Green, Blue, Alpha) format. The following code shows examples of correct and incorrect values passed to `rgba()`.

```css
/* These examples use the same color: blueviolet. */
.broken {
  --violet: #8a2be2;

  /* rgba(#8a2be2, .5) */
  color: rgba(var(--violet), 0.5); /* ERROR! Doesn't support hex. */
}

.working {
  --violet-rgb: 138, 43, 226;

  /* rgba(138, 43, 226, .5) */
  color: rgba(var(--violet-rgb), 0.5); /* WORKS! */
}
```

:::note
See the [CSS Variables](css-variables.md) section for more information on how to get and set CSS variables.
:::

Ionic uses colors with an opacity (alpha) in several components. In order for this to work, those properties must be provided in RGB format. When changing any of the properties that have a variation ending in `-rgb`, it is important they are also provided in a comma separated format **without parentheses**. Below are some examples for changing text and background color.

```css
:root {
  /* These examples use the same color: sienna. */
  --ion-text-color: #a0522d;
  --ion-text-color-rgb: 160, 82, 45;

  /* These examples use the same color: lightsteelblue. */
  --ion-background-color: #b0c4de;
  --ion-background-color-rgb: 176, 196, 222;
}
```

Note that the RGB formatted colors are the exact same color as the hex properties, but can now be used with `rgba()`. For example, `--ion-text-color-rgb` can now be used in the following way

```css
body {
  color: rgba(var(--ion-text-color-rgb), 0.25);
}
```

### Variables in Media Queries

CSS variables in [media queries](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries) are not currently supported, but there are open drafts to add [custom media queries](https://drafts.csswg.org/mediaqueries-5/#custom-mq) and [custom environment variables](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-env-1/) that would solve this problem! However, with the current state of support, the following will **not** work:

```css
:root {
  --breakpoint: 600px;
}

@media (min-width: var(--breakpoint)) {
  /* Doesn't work :( */
}
```

### Modifying CSS Color Variables

While it is possible to easily alter a color in Sass using its built-in functions, it is currently not as easy to modify colors set in CSS Variables. This can be accomplished in CSS by splitting the [RGB](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/RGB) or [HSL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL_and_HSV) channels and modifying each value, but it is complex and has missing functionality.

What exactly does this mean? Basically, using a CSS preprocessor, such as Sass, allows us to use functions to manipulate a single color. For example, we can create the following colors in Sass:

```scss
// Background color, shade, and tint
$background: #0054e9;
$background-shade: mix(#000, $background, 12%);
$background-tint: mix(#fff, $background, 10%);

// Text color, darker and lighter
$text: #444;
$text-darker: darken($text, 15);
$text-lighter: lighten($text, 15);
```

After running through the Sass compiler, the colors will have the following values:

| Variable            | Value                                          |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `$background`       | <CodeColor color="#0054e9">#0054e9</CodeColor> |
| `$background-shade` | <CodeColor color="#004acd">#004acd</CodeColor> |
| `$background-tint`  | <CodeColor color="#1a65eb">#1a65eb</CodeColor> |
| `$text`             | <CodeColor color="#444444">#444444</CodeColor> |
| `$text-darker`      | <CodeColor color="#1e1e1e">#1e1e1e</CodeColor> |
| `$text-lighter`     | <CodeColor color="#6a6a6a">#6a6a6a</CodeColor> |

However, because CSS variables can be set at runtime and are more dynamic, it is not currently possible to manipulate them using a simple function.

This is normally not a problem, but when an application needs to have dynamic theming it presents issues. In Ionic, this is the reason that there are [variations to each color](colors.md#layered-colors), and it is also why [stepped colors](themes.md#stepped-colors) are necessary for theming.

There are drafts and issues discussing [color modification proposals](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/3187) that would make this possible.

## Safe Area Padding

The safe area of a display is the section that is not covered by the device's notch, status bar, or other elements that are part of the device's UI and not the app's. The dimensions of the safe area are different across devices and orientations (portrait or landscape).

For example, below are screenshots of an iPhone 14 Pro Max. The red section is the safe area, and the white sections are places where the app's content would be covered up.

| Portrait                                                                       | Landscape                                                                        |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <img src={require('@site/static/img/theming/ios-portrait-top.png').default} /> | <img src={require('@site/static/img/theming/ios-landscape-left.png').default} /> |

To accommodate this, Ionic automatically adds padding to certain components. For example, the first `ion-toolbar` component placed in an `ion-modal` will receive padding according to the top edge of the device's safe area. This avoids the device's notch covering up the header text.

<img src={require('@site/static/img/theming/modal-header-padding.png').default} />

This padding can be manually adjusted through CSS using the `--ion-safe-area-(dir)` variables described in [Application Variables](#application-variables). Values can be set for the whole application, or on a per component basis. For example:

```css
html {
  --ion-safe-area-left: 25px;
}

ion-modal {
  --ion-safe-area-top: 0;
}
```

  <title>Theming | Ionic Apps: Color and Theming Basics Definition</title>
  <meta
    name="description"
    content="The definition of theming apps just got simplified. Ionic Framework is built with pre-baked styles and colors which are extremely easy to change and modify."
  />
</head>

Ionic Framework is built to be a blank slate that can easily be customized and modified to fit a brand, while still following the standards of the different platforms. Theming Ionic apps is now easier than ever. Because the framework is built with CSS, it comes with pre-baked default styles which are extremely easy to change and modify.

## Colors

Ionic has nine default colors that can be used to change the color of many components. Each color is actually a collection of multiple properties, including a `shade` and `tint`, used throughout Ionic.

When changing a color, it is important to set all of the related properties. This can be done easily with the [Color Generator](color-generator.md) tool, but these can also be manually written if desired. For more information on Ionic colors, see [Colors](colors.md).

<ColorAccordion />

## Platform Standards

Ionic components adapt their look and behavior based on the platform the app is running on. We call this <strong>Adaptive Styling</strong>. This allows developers to build apps that use the same codebase for multiple platforms, while still looking "native" to those particular platforms.

Ionic has two **modes** that are used to customize the look of components based on the **platform**: `ios` and `md`. Each platform has a default mode, but this can easily be configured. For more information on customizing an application based on the platform, see [Platform Styles](platform-styles.md).

## CSS Variables

The Ionic Framework components are themed using <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_variables" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CSS custom properties (variables)</a>. CSS variables add dynamic values to an otherwise static language. This is something that has traditionally required a CSS preprocessor like Sass. The look of an application can easily be changed by changing the value of any of the [CSS Variables](css-variables.md) Ionic Framework provides.

## CSS Shadow Parts

CSS Shadow Parts were added to make it easier to fully customize Ionic Framework Shadow components. In the past, components that use <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_shadow_DOM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shadow DOM</a> were unable to have elements inside of their shadow tree styled directly. With the addition of Shadow parts, there is no longer a need for CSS variables for every property on an inner element of a Shadow component. For more information on customizing Ionic Framework components using parts, see the [CSS Shadow Parts](css-shadow-parts.md) guide.

## Branding

Ionic provides application colors that can be used to theme an application to match a brand or color scheme. The default theme uses a light background, but everything from the background color to the text color is fully customizable. For more information on branding, see [Themes](themes.md).

</head>

Ionic has nine default colors that can be used to change the color of many components. Each color is actually a collection of multiple properties, including a `shade` and `tint`, used throughout Ionic.

A color can be applied to an Ionic component in order to change the default colors using the `color` attribute. Notice in the buttons below that the text and background changes based on the `color` set. When there is no `color` set on the button it uses the `primary` color by default.

```html
<ion-button>Default</ion-button>
<ion-button color="primary">Primary</ion-button>
<ion-button color="secondary">Secondary</ion-button>
<ion-button color="tertiary">Tertiary</ion-button>
<ion-button color="success">Success</ion-button>
<ion-button color="warning">Warning</ion-button>
<ion-button color="danger">Danger</ion-button>
<ion-button color="light">Light</ion-button>
<ion-button color="medium">Medium</ion-button>
<ion-button color="dark">Dark</ion-button>
```

## Layered Colors

Each color consists of the following properties: a `base`, `contrast`, `shade`, and `tint`. The `base` and `contrast` colors also require a `rgb` property which is the same color, just in <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/RGB" target="_blank">rgb format</a>. See [The Alpha Problem](advanced.md#the-alpha-problem) for an explanation of why the `rgb` property is also needed. Select from the dropdown below to see all of the default colors Ionic provides and their variations.

<LayeredColorsSelect />

## Modifying Colors

To change the default values of a color, all of the listed variations for that color should be set. For example, to change the secondary color to <CodeColor color="#006600">#006600</CodeColor>, set the following CSS properties:

```css
:root {
  --ion-color-secondary: #006600;
  --ion-color-secondary-rgb: 0, 102, 0;
  --ion-color-secondary-contrast: #ffffff;
  --ion-color-secondary-contrast-rgb: 255, 255, 255;
  --ion-color-secondary-shade: #005a00;
  --ion-color-secondary-tint: #1a751a;
}
```

When `secondary` is applied to a button, not only is the base color <CodeColor color="#006600">#006600</CodeColor> used, but the contrast color <CodeColor color="#ffffff">#ffffff</CodeColor> is used for the text, along with shade <CodeColor color="#005a00">#005a00</CodeColor> and tint <CodeColor color="#1a751a">#1a751a</CodeColor> colors for the different states of the button.

:::note
Not sure how to get the variation colors from the base color? Try out our [Color Generator](color-generator.md) that calculates all of the variations and provides code to copy/paste into an app!
:::

See the [CSS Variables documentation](css-variables.md) for more information on CSS variables.

## Adding Colors

Colors can be added for use throughout an application by setting the `color` property on an Ionic component, or by styling with CSS. Read on to see how to manually add a new color, or use the [New Color Creator](#new-color-creator) below for a quick way to generate the code of a new color to be copy and pasted into an application.

To add a new color, first define the CSS variables for all of the variations of the color at the root. For example, to add a new color called `favorite`, we can define the following variables:

```css
:root {
  --ion-color-favorite: #69bb7b;
  --ion-color-favorite-rgb: 105, 187, 123;
  --ion-color-favorite-contrast: #ffffff;
  --ion-color-favorite-contrast-rgb: 255, 255, 255;
  --ion-color-favorite-shade: #5ca56c;
  --ion-color-favorite-tint: #78c288;
}
```

Then, create a new class that uses these CSS variables. The class **must** be written in the format `.ion-color-{COLOR}` where `{COLOR}` is the name of the color to add:

```css
.ion-color-favorite {
  --ion-color-base: var(--ion-color-favorite);
  --ion-color-base-rgb: var(--ion-color-favorite-rgb);
  --ion-color-contrast: var(--ion-color-favorite-contrast);
  --ion-color-contrast-rgb: var(--ion-color-favorite-contrast-rgb);
  --ion-color-shade: var(--ion-color-favorite-shade);
  --ion-color-tint: var(--ion-color-favorite-tint);
}
```

After the class is added, the color can be used on any Ionic component that supports the `color` property. An example of using the `favorite` color on an Ionic button is below.

```html
<ion-button color="favorite">Favorite</ion-button>
```

The CSS variables defined at the root can also be used to style any element using CSS:

```css
div {
  background: var(--ion-color-favorite);
  color: var(--ion-color-favorite-contrast);
}
```

See the [CSS Variables documentation](css-variables.md) for more information on setting and using CSS variables.

</head>

CSS Shadow Parts allow developers to style CSS properties on an element inside of a shadow tree. This is extremely useful in customizing Ionic Framework <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_shadow_DOM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shadow DOM</a> components.

## Why Shadow Parts?

Ionic Framework is a distributed set of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Web Components</a>. Web Components follow the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/webcomponents/spec/shadow/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shadow DOM specification</a> in order to encapsulate styles and markup.

:::note
Ionic Framework components are **not all** Shadow DOM components. If the component is a Shadow DOM component, there will be a badge in the top right of its [component documentation](../components.md). An example of a Shadow DOM component is the [button component](../api/button.md).
:::

Shadow DOM is useful for preventing styles from leaking out of components and unintentionally applying to other elements. For example, we assign a `.button` class to our `ion-button` component. Without Shadow DOM encapsulation, if a user were to set the class `.button` on one of their own elements, it would inherit the Ionic Framework button styles. Since `ion-button` is a Shadow component, this is not a problem.

However, due to this encapsulation, styles aren’t able to bleed into inner elements of Shadow components either. This means that if a Shadow component renders elements inside of its shadow tree, the inner elements cannot be targeted directly with CSS. Using the `ion-select` component as an example, it renders the following markup:

```html
<ion-select>
  #shadow-root
  <div class="select-text select-placeholder"></div>
  <div class="select-icon"></div>
</ion-select>
```

The placeholder text and icon elements are inside of the `#shadow-root`, which means the following CSS will **NOT** work to style the placeholder:

```css
/* Does NOT work */
ion-select .select-placeholder {
  color: blue;
}
```

So how do we solve this? [CSS Shadow Parts](#shadow-parts-explained)!

## Shadow Parts Explained

Shadow parts allow developers to style inside a shadow tree, from outside of that shadow tree. In order to do so, the [part must be exposed](#exposing-a-part) and then it can be styled by using [::part](#how-part-works).

### Exposing a part

When creating a Shadow DOM component, a part can be added to an element inside of a shadow tree by assigning a `part` attribute on the element. This is added to the component in Ionic Framework and requires no action from an end user.

Continuing to use the `ion-select` component as an example, the markup is updated to look like the following:

```html
<ion-select>
  #shadow-root
  <div part="placeholder" class="select-text select-placeholder"></div>
  <div part="icon" class="select-icon"></div>
</ion-select>
```

The above shows two parts: `placeholder` and `icon`. See the [select documentation](../api/select.md#css-shadow-parts) for all of its parts.

With these parts exposed, the element can now be styled directly using [::part](#how-part-works).

### How ::part works

The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/::part" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">`::part()`</a> pseudo-element allows developers to select elements inside of a shadow tree that have been exposed via a part attribute.

Since we know that `ion-select` exposes a `placeholder` part for styling the text when there is no value selected, we can customize it in the following way:

```css
ion-select::part(placeholder) {
  color: blue;
  opacity: 1;
}
```

Styling using `::part` allows any CSS property that is accepted by that element to be changed.

In addition to being able to target the part, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-elements" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pseudo-elements</a> can be styled without them being explicitly exposed:

```css
ion-select::part(placeholder)::first-letter {
  font-size: 22px;
  font-weight: 500;
}
```

Parts work with most <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-classes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pseudo-classes</a>, as well:

```css
ion-item::part(native):hover {
  color: green;
}
```

:::note
There are some known limitations with [vendor prefixed pseudo-elements](#vendor-prefixed-pseudo-elements) and [structural pseudo-classes](#structural-pseudo-classes).
:::

## Ionic Framework Parts

All exposed parts for an Ionic Framework component can be found under the CSS Shadow Parts heading on its API page. To view all components and their API pages, see the [Component documentation](../components.md).

In order to have parts a component must meet the following criteria:

- It is a [Shadow DOM](../reference/glossary.md#shadow) component. If it is a [Scoped](../reference/glossary.md#scoped) or Light DOM component, the child elements can be targeted directly. If a component is Scoped or Shadow, it will be listed by its name on its [component documentation page](../components.md).
- It contains children elements. For example, `ion-card-header` is a Shadow component, but all styles are applied to the host element. Since it has no child elements, there’s no need for parts.
- The children elements are not structural. In certain components, including `ion-title`, the child element is a structural element used to position the inner elements. We do not recommend customizing structural elements as this can have unexpected results.

## Known Limitations

### Browser Support

CSS Shadow Parts are supported in the recent versions of all of the major browsers. However, some of the older versions do not support shadow parts. Verify the <a href="https://caniuse.com/#feat=mdn-css_selectors_part" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">browser support</a> meets the requirements before implementing parts in an app. If browser support for older versions is required, we recommend continuing to use [CSS Variables](../theming/css-variables.md) for styling.

### Vendor Prefixed Pseudo-Elements

<p>
  <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Vendor_Prefix" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
    Vendor prefixed
  </a>{' '}
  pseudo-elements are not supported at this time. An example of this would be any of the `::-webkit-scrollbar`
  pseudo-elements:
</p>

```css
/* Does NOT work */
my-component::part(scroll)::-webkit-scrollbar {
  background: green;
}
```

See <a href="https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/4530" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this issue on GitHub</a> for more information.

### Structural Pseudo-Classes

Most pseudo-classes are supported with parts, however, <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/selectors-4/#structural-pseudos" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">structural pseudo-classes</a> are not. An example of structural pseudo-classes that do not work is below.

```css
/* Does NOT work */
my-component::part(container):first-child {
  background: green;
}

/* Does NOT work */
my-component::part(container):last-child {
  background: green;
}
```

### Chaining Parts

The `::part()` pseudo-element can not match additional `::part()`s.

For example, `my-component::part(button)::part(label)` does not match anything. This is because doing so would expose more structural information than is intended.

If the `<my-component>`’s internal button uses something like `part="label => button-label"` to forward the button’s internal parts up into the panel’s own part element map, then a selector like `my-component::part(button-label)` would select just the one button’s label, ignoring any other labels.

</head>

Ionic components are built with <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_variables" target="_blank">CSS Variables</a> for easy customization of an application. CSS variables allow a value to be stored in one place, then referenced in multiple other places. They also make it possible to change CSS dynamically at runtime (which previously required a CSS preprocessor). CSS variables make it easier than ever to override Ionic components to match a brand or theme.

## Setting Values

### Global Variables

CSS variables can be set globally in an application in the `:root` selector. They can also be applied only for a specific mode. See [Ionic Variables](#ionic-variables) for more information on the global variables Ionic provides.

When using the Ionic CLI to start an Angular, React or Vue project, the `src/theme/variables.scss` file is created where you can override the default Ionic Variables.

```css
/* Set variables for all modes */
:root {
  /* Set the background of the entire app */
  --ion-background-color: #ff3700;

  /* Set the font family of the entire app */
  --ion-font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Helvetica Neue', 'Roboto', sans-serif;
}

/* Set text color of the entire app for iOS only */
:root.ios {
  --ion-text-color: #000;
}

/* Set text color of the entire app for Material Design only */
:root.md {
  --ion-text-color: #222;
}
```

### Component Variables

To set a CSS variable for a specific component, add the variable inside of its selector. See [Ionic Variables](#ionic-variables) for more information on the component-level variables Ionic provides.

```css
/* Set the color on all ion-button elements */
ion-button {
  --color: #222;
}

/* Set the background on an ion-button with the .fancy-button class */
.fancy-button {
  --background: #00ff00;
}
```

### Variables set via JavaScript

CSS variables can also be changed via JavaScript using [setProperty()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CSSStyleDeclaration/setProperty):

```js
const el = document.querySelector('.fancy-button');
el.style.setProperty('--background', '#36454f');
```

## Getting Values

### Using CSS

The [var() CSS function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/var) can be used to get the value of a CSS variable, along with any number of fallback values, if desired. In the below example, the `--background` property will be set to the value of the `--charcoal` variable, if defined, and if not it will use `#36454f`.

```css
.fancy-button {
  --background: var(--charcoal, #36454f);
}
```

### Using JavaScript

The value of a CSS variable can be read in JavaScript using [getPropertyValue()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CSSStyleDeclaration/getPropertyValue):

```js
const el = document.querySelector('.fancy-button');
const color = el.style.getPropertyValue('--background');
```

## Ionic Variables

### Component Variables

Ionic provides variables that exist at the component level, such as `--background` and `--color`. For a list of the custom properties a component accepts, view the `CSS Custom Properties` section of its [API reference](../api.md). For example, see the [Button CSS Custom Properties](../api/button.md#css-custom-properties).

### Global Variables

There are several global variables that Ionic provides in order to make theming an entire application easier. For more information, see [Colors](colors.md), [Themes](themes.md) and [Advanced Theming](advanced.md).

  <title>Dark Mode to Change Color Schemes and CSS Properties</title>
  <meta

    content="Developers are adding dark mode CSS on native applications to support their user preferences. Read to learn more about dark color schemes for Ionic apps."
  />
</head>

Ionic makes it easy to change the palettes of your app, including supporting dark color schemes. Dark mode is a display setting that changes all of an app's views to a dark palette. It has system-wide support on iOS and Android, making it highly desirable for developers to add to their apps.

## Enabling Dark Palette

There are three provided ways to enable the dark palette in an app: **always**, based on **system** settings, or by using a CSS **class**.

### Always

The default palette provided with Ionic Framework is a light palette, consisting of a light background and dark text. However, the default palette can be changed to the dark palette by importing the following stylesheet in the appropriate files:

<Tabs groupId="framework" defaultValue="angular" values={[{ value: 'angular', label: 'Angular' }, { value: 'javascript', label: 'Javascript' }, { value: 'react', label: 'React' }, { value: 'vue', label: 'Vue' }]}>

<TabItem value="angular">

```css
@import '@ionic/angular/css/palettes/dark.always.css';
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="javascript">

```ts
import '@ionic/core/css/palettes/dark.always.css';
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="react">

```tsx
import '@ionic/react/css/palettes/dark.always.css';
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="vue">

```ts
import '@ionic/vue/css/palettes/dark.always.css';
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

This sets the [application colors](/docs/theming/themes#application-colors) and [stepped colors](/docs/theming/themes#stepped-colors) on the [`:root`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:root) selector.

The following example will always display the dark palette, regardless of the system settings for dark mode.

import AlwaysDarkMode from '@site/static/usage/v8/theming/always-dark-mode/index.md';

<AlwaysDarkMode />

:::caution Important
Avoid targeting the `.ios` or `.md` selectors to override the Ionic dark palette, as these classes are added to each component and will take priority over globally defined variables. Instead, we can target the mode-specific classes on the `:root` element.
:::

### System

The system approach to enable dark mode involves checking the system settings for the user's preferred color scheme. This is the default when starting a new Ionic Framework app. Importing the following stylesheet in the appropriate file will automatically retrieve the user's preference from the system settings and apply the dark palette when dark mode is preferred:

<Tabs groupId="framework" defaultValue="angular" values={[{ value: 'angular', label: 'Angular' }, { value: 'javascript', label: 'Javascript' }, { value: 'react', label: 'React' }, { value: 'vue', label: 'Vue' }]}>

<TabItem value="angular">

```css
@import '@ionic/angular/css/palettes/dark.system.css';
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="javascript">

```ts
import '@ionic/core/css/palettes/dark.system.css';
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="react">

```tsx
import '@ionic/react/css/palettes/dark.system.css';
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="vue">

```ts
import '@ionic/vue/css/palettes/dark.system.css';
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

This sets the [application colors](/docs/theming/themes#application-colors) and [stepped colors](/docs/theming/themes#stepped-colors) when the [CSS media query for `prefers-color-scheme`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-color-scheme) is `dark`. The `prefers-color-scheme` media query is supported by [all modern browsers](https://caniuse.com/#feat=prefers-color-scheme). If support for older browser is required, we recommend using the [CSS class](#css-class) approach.

The following example uses the system settings to decide when to show dark mode.

:::info

:::

import SystemDarkMode from '@site/static/usage/v8/theming/system-dark-mode/index.md';

<SystemDarkMode />

:::caution Important
Avoid targeting the `.ios` or `.md` selectors to override the Ionic dark palette, as these classes are added to each component and will take priority over globally defined variables. Instead, we can target the mode-specific classes on the `:root` element.
:::

### CSS Class

While the previous approaches are excellent for enabling the dark palette through file imports alone, there are scenarios where you may need more control over its application. In cases where you need to apply the dark palette conditionally, such as through a toggle, or if you want to extend the functionality based on system settings, we provide a dark palette class file. This file applies the dark palette when a specific class is added to an app. Importing the following stylesheet into the appropriate file will provide the necessary styles for using the dark palette with the class:

<Tabs groupId="framework" defaultValue="angular" values={[{ value: 'angular', label: 'Angular' }, { value: 'javascript', label: 'Javascript' }, { value: 'react', label: 'React' }, { value: 'vue', label: 'Vue' }]}>

<TabItem value="angular">

```css
@import '@ionic/angular/css/palettes/dark.class.css';
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="javascript">

```ts
import '@ionic/core/css/palettes/dark.class.css';
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="react">

```tsx
import '@ionic/react/css/palettes/dark.class.css';
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="vue">

```ts
import '@ionic/vue/css/palettes/dark.class.css';
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

This sets the [application colors](/docs/theming/themes#application-colors) and [stepped colors](/docs/theming/themes#stepped-colors) on the `.ion-palette-dark` selector, which must be applied to the app by the developer.

The following example combines site settings, system settings, and the toggle to decide when to show dark mode. The site's palette takes precedence over system settings. If your system settings differ from the site's palette when the demo loads, it will use the site's palette.

:::info

:::

import ClassDarkMode from '@site/static/usage/v8/theming/class-dark-mode/index.md';

<ClassDarkMode />

:::caution Important
The `.ion-palette-dark` class **must** be added to the `html` element in order to work with the imported dark palette.
:::

## Adjusting System UI Components

When developing a dark palette, you may notice that certain system UI components are not adjusting to dark mode properly. To fix this you will need to specify the `color-scheme`. See the <a href="https://caniuse.com/#feat=mdn-html_elements_meta_name_color-scheme" target="_blank">browser compatibility for color-scheme</a> for details on cross browser support.

While you may be mainly using Ionic components instead of only native components, `color-scheme` can also affect aspects of your application such as the scrollbar. In order to use `color-scheme` you will need to add the following HTML to the `head` of your application:

```html
<meta name="color-scheme" content="light dark" />
```

This allows the page to indicate which color scheme it is comfortable being rendered with. Alternatively, you can add the following CSS to do this on a per-element basis:

```css
color-scheme: light dark;
```

| Default scrollbar                                                                                                                                      | Scrollbar with `color-scheme`                                                                                                                                                                                     |

## Ionic Dark Palette

Ionic has a recommended dark palette that can be enabled in three different ways: [always](#always), based on [system](#system) settings, or by using a [CSS class](#css-class). Each of these methods involves importing the dark palette file with the corresponding name.

The contents of each file are included below for reference. These variables are set by importing the relevant dark palette file and do not need to be copied into an app. For more information on the variables being changed, including additional variables for further customization, refer to the [Themes](themes.md) section.

<Tabs groupId="darkFiles" defaultValue="always" values={[{ value: 'always', label: 'Always (dark.always.css)' }, { value: 'system', label: 'System (dark.system.css)' }, { value: 'class', label: 'Class (dark.class.css)' }]}>

<TabItem value="always">

The **always** dark palette behaves in the following ways:

1. Sets the [Ionic colors](colors.md) for all [modes](platform-styles.md#ionic-modes) to complement a dark palette in the `:root` selector. The [`:root`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:root) selector is identical to the selector `html`, except that its [specificity](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Specificity) is higher.
2. Setting variables for the dark palette on `ios` devices using the `:root.ios` selector.
3. Setting variables for the dark palette on `md` devices using the `:root.md` selector.

:::caution
It is important to pay attention to the specificity if you want to override any of the Ionic dark palette variables. For example, because the `--ion-item-background` variable is set for each mode, it cannot be overridden in the `:root` selector. A higher specificity selector, such as `:root.ios`, is required.

<TabItem value="system">

The **system** dark palette behaves in the following ways:

1. Sets the [Ionic colors](colors.md) for all [modes](platform-styles.md#ionic-modes) to complement a dark palette in the `:root` selector. The [`:root`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:root) selector is identical to the selector `html`, except that its [specificity](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Specificity) is higher.
2. Setting variables for the dark palette on `ios` devices using the `:root.ios` selector.
3. Setting variables for the dark palette on `md` devices using the `:root.md` selector.
4. Only applies these variables when the [CSS media query for `prefers-color-scheme`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-color-scheme) is `dark`.

:::caution
It is important to pay attention to the specificity if you want to override any of the Ionic dark palette variables.

<TabItem value="class">

The **class** dark palette behaves in the following ways:

1. Sets the [Ionic colors](colors.md) for all [modes](platform-styles.md#ionic-modes) to complement a dark palette in the `.ion-palette-dark` selector. The `.ion-palette-dark` class must be added to the `html` element in an app.

  <title>High Contrast Mode to Increase Color Contrast</title>
  <meta
    name="description"
    content="Developers are adding high contrast mode CSS on native applications to support their user preferences. Read to learn more about high contrast color schemes for Ionic apps."
  />
</head>

Ionic offers palettes with increased contrast for users with low vision. These palettes work by amplifying the contrast between foreground content, such as text, and background content, such as UI components. Ionic provides both light and dark variants for achieving high contrast.

## Overview

The default palette in Ionic provides [Ionic colors](./colors.md) that meet [Level AA color contrast](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/contrast-minimum.html) as defined by Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) when used with the appropriate contrast color. The [Ionic colors](./colors.md) in the high contrast palette have been updated to meet [Level AAA color contrast](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/contrast-enhanced.html) when used with the appropriate contrast color. Notably, improvements have been made to the contrast of UI components, including border, text, and background colors. However, it's important to note that within the high contrast palette, priority is given to text legibility. This means that if adjusting the contrast of a UI component against the page background would significantly compromise the contrast between the component's text and its background, the contrast of the UI component background will remain unchanged.

## Enabling High Contrast Theme

There are three provided ways to enable the high contrast palette in an app: **always**, based on **system** settings, or by using a CSS **class**.

### Always

The high contrast palette can be enabled by importing the following stylesheet in the appropriate files. This approach will enable the high contrast palette regardless of the system settings for contrast preference.

<Tabs groupId="framework" defaultValue="angular" values={[{ value: 'angular', label: 'Angular' }, { value: 'javascript', label: 'Javascript' }, { value: 'react', label: 'React' }, { value: 'vue', label: 'Vue' }]}>

<TabItem value="angular">

```scss
@import '@ionic/angular/css/palettes/high-contrast.always.css'; // Light palette
// @import '@ionic/angular/css/palettes/high-contrast-dark.always.css'; // Dark palette
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="javascript">

```typescript
import '@ionic/core/css/palettes/high-contrast.always.css'; // Light palette
// import '@ionic/core/css/palettes/high-contrast-dark.always.css'; // Dark palette
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="react">

```tsx
import '@ionic/react/css/palettes/high-contrast.always.css'; // Light palette
// import '@ionic/react/css/palettes/high-contrast-dark.always.css'; // Dark palette
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="vue">

```typescript
import '@ionic/vue/css/palettes/high-contrast.always.css'; // Light palette
// import '@ionic/vue/css/palettes/high-contrast-dark.always.css'; // Dark palette
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

The high contrast dark palette can be applied by importing `high-contrast-dark.always.css` instead of `high-contrast.always.css`.

The following example will always display the high contrast light palette, regardless of the user's preference for high contrast or dark mode.

import AlwaysHighContrastMode from '@site/static/usage/v8/theming/always-high-contrast-mode/index.md';

<AlwaysHighContrastMode />

### System

The system approach to enabling high contrast mode involves checking the system settings for the user's preferred contrast. This is the default when starting a new Ionic Framework app. Importing the following stylesheets in the appropriate file will automatically retrieve the user's preference from the system settings and apply the high contrast palette when high contrast is preferred.

The following example shows how to include both the high contrast light palette as well as the high contrast dark palette. The system's dark mode preference will be checked to show either the light or dark variant of the high contrast palette.

<Tabs groupId="framework" defaultValue="angular" values={[{ value: 'angular', label: 'Angular' }, { value: 'javascript', label: 'Javascript' }, { value: 'react', label: 'React' }, { value: 'vue', label: 'Vue' }]}>

<TabItem value="angular">

```css
@import '@ionic/angular/css/palettes/high-contrast.system.css';
@import '@ionic/angular/css/palettes/high-contrast-dark.system.css';
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="javascript">

```ts
import '@ionic/core/css/palettes/high-contrast.system.css';
import '@ionic/core/css/palettes/high-contrast-dark.system.css';
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="react">

```tsx
import '@ionic/react/css/palettes/high-contrast.system.css';
import '@ionic/react/css/palettes/high-contrast-dark.system.css';
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="vue">

```ts
import '@ionic/vue/css/palettes/high-contrast.system.css';
import '@ionic/vue/css/palettes/high-contrast-dark.system.css';
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

This approach activates the high contrast palette when the [CSS media query for `prefers-contrast`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-contrast) is `more`. The `prefers-contrast` media query is supported by [all modern browsers](https://caniuse.com/?search=prefers-contrast). If support for an older browser is required, we recommend using the [CSS class](#css-class) approach.

The following example uses the system settings to decide when to show high contrast mode.

:::info

Here's how to enable high contrast mode on [Windows 11](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/turn-high-contrast-mode-on-or-off-in-windows-909e9d89-a0f9-a3a9-b993-7a6dcee85025) and on [macOS](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/change-display-settings-for-accessibility-unac089/mac).
:::

import SystemHighContrastMode from '@site/static/usage/v8/theming/system-high-contrast-mode/index.md';

<SystemHighContrastMode />

:::caution
The high contrast light palette must be imported after [core.css](../layout/global-stylesheets.md#corecss), and the
high contrast dark palette must be imported after `dark.system.css`. Otherwise, the standard contrast palette will take priority.
:::

### CSS Class

While the previous approaches are excellent for enabling the high contrast palette through file imports alone, there are scenarios where you may need more control over where it is applied. In cases where you need to apply the high contrast palette conditionally, such as through a toggle, or if you want to extend the functionality based on system settings, we provide a high contrast palette class file. This file applies the high contrast palette when a specific class is added to an app. Importing the following stylesheets into the appropriate file will provide the necessary styles for using the high contrast palette with the class:

<Tabs groupId="framework" defaultValue="angular" values={[{ value: 'angular', label: 'Angular' }, { value: 'javascript', label: 'Javascript' }, { value: 'react', label: 'React' }, { value: 'vue', label: 'Vue' }]}>

import '@ionic/vue/css/palettes/high-contrast-dark.class.css';
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

This approach activates the high contrast palette when the `.ion-palette-high-contrast` class is set on the `html` element. This class must be applied by the developer. This can be combined with the [`.ion-palette-dark` class](./dark-mode.md#css-class) to conditionally apply the high contrast dark palette.

The following example combines site settings, system settings, and the toggle to decide when to show high contrast mode. The site's palette takes precedence over system settings. If your system settings differ from the site's palette when the demo loads, it will use the site's palette.

Here's how to enable high contrast mode on [Windows 11](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/turn-high-contrast-mode-on-or-off-in-windows-909e9d89-a0f9-a3a9-b993-7a6dcee85025) and on [macOS](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/change-display-settings-for-accessibility-unac089/mac).
:::

import ClassHighContrastMode from '@site/static/usage/v8/theming/class-high-contrast-mode/index.md';

<ClassHighContrastMode />

:::caution
The high contrast light palette must be imported after [core.css](../layout/global-stylesheets.md#corecss),
and the high contrast dark palette must be imported after `dark.class.css`. Otherwise, the standard contrast palette will take
priority.

:::caution
The `.ion-palette-high-contrast` class **must** be added to the `html` element in order to work with the imported high contrast palette.

## Customizing Ionic High Contrast Theme

Ionic has a recommended high contrast palette that can be enabled in three different ways: [always](#always), based on [system](#system) settings, or by using a [CSS class](#css-class). Each of these methods involves importing the high contrast palette file with the corresponding name.

The theme variables are set by importing the relevant high contrast palette file and do not need to be copied into an app. For more information on the variables being changed, including additional variables for further customization, refer to the [Themes](themes.md) section.

The following provides details on how to customize the high contrast palette depending on how it was applied in an application.

<Tabs groupId="highContrastFile" defaultValue="always" values={[{ value: 'always', label: 'Always' }, { value: 'system', label: 'System' }, { value: 'class', label: 'Class' }]}>

<TabItem value="always">

The **always** high contrast palette can be accessed by importing `high-contrast.always.css` for the light variant and `high-contrast-dark.always.css` for the dark variant.

The **always** high contrast palette behaves in the following ways:

1. Sets the [Ionic colors](colors.md) for all [modes](platform-styles.md#ionic-modes) to complement a high contrast palette in the `:root` selector. The [`:root`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:root) selector is identical to the selector `html`, except that its [specificity](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Specificity) is higher.
2. Setting variables for the high contrast palette on `ios` devices using the `:root.ios` selector.
3. Setting variables for the high contrast palette on `md` devices using the `:root.md` selector.

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="system">

The **system** high contrast palette can be accessed by importing `high-contrast.system.css` for the light variant and `high-contrast-dark.system.css` for the dark variant.

The **system** high contrast palette behaves in the following ways:

1. Sets the [Ionic colors](colors.md) for all [modes](platform-styles.md#ionic-modes) to complement a high contrast palette in the `:root` selector. The [`:root`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:root) selector is identical to the selector `html`, except that its [specificity](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Specificity) is higher.
2. Setting variables for the high contrast palette on `ios` devices using the `:root.ios` selector.
3. Setting variables for the high contrast palette on `md` devices using the `:root.md` selector.
4. Only applies these variables when the [CSS media query for `prefers-contrast`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-contrast) is `more`.

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="class">

The **class** high contrast palette can be accessed by importing `high-contrast.class.css` for the light variant and `high-contrast-dark.class.css` for the dark variant.

The **class** high contrast palette behaves in the following ways:

1. Sets the [Ionic colors](colors.md) for all [modes](platform-styles.md#ionic-modes) to complement a high contrast palette in the `.ion-palette-high-contrast` selector. The `.ion-palette-high-contrast` class must be added to the `html` element in an app.
2. Setting variables for the high contrast palette on `ios` devices using the `.ion-palette-high-contrast.ios` selector.
3. Setting variables for the high contrast palette on `md` devices using the `.ion-palette-high-contrast.md` selector.

  />
</head>

Ionic provides platform specific styles based on the device the application is running on. Styling the components to match the device guidelines allows the application to be written once but look and feel native to the user depending on where it is accessed.

## Ionic Modes

Ionic uses **modes** to customize the look of components. Each **platform** has a default **mode**, but this can be overridden through the global [config](../developing/config.md). The following chart displays the default **mode** that is added to each **platform**:

| Platform  | Mode  | Description                                                                                                                      |
| --------- | ----- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ios`     | `ios` | Viewing on an iPhone, iPad, or iPod will use the [iOS styles](https://www.apple.com/ios).                                        |
| `android` | `md`  | Viewing on any Android device will use the [Material Design styles](https://material.io/guidelines/).                            |
| `core`    | `md`  | Any platform that doesn't fit any of the above platforms will use the [Material Design styles](https://material.io/guidelines/). |

For example, an app being viewed on an Android platform will use the `md` (Material Design) mode by default. The `<html>` element will have `class="md"` added to it and all of the components will use Material Design styles:

```html
<html class="md"></html>
```

_Note: The **platform** and the **mode** are not the same. The platform can be set to use any mode in the [config](../developing/config.md) of an app._

## Overriding Mode Styles

Each Ionic component can be styled based on the mode. The `html` element has both a `class` and `mode` attribute with a value equal to the current mode. These can be used to override styles for any component. For example, to style an `ion-badge` to have `uppercase` text only in `ios` mode:

```css
.ios ion-badge {
  text-transform: uppercase;
}
```

There are also many global CSS variables that can be used to override the styles. To style the background color for an `ios` app, the following can be written:

```css
.ios {
  --ion-background-color: #222;
}
```

There are many global variables that can be overridden by mode, including [Ionic's color variables](colors.md), [theme variables](themes.md) and [global component variables](advanced.md).

  <title>Ionic App Themes | Change Default App Background Themes & Colors</title>
  <meta
    name="description"
    content="Several global variables change the default theme of an entire application. Create a custom background and text color theme for your app with Ionic themes."
  />
</head>

Ionic provides several global variables that are used throughout components to change the default theme of an entire application. [Application Colors](#application-colors) are useful to change the look of most of the Ionic components, and [Stepped Colors](#stepped-colors) are used as variations in some of the Ionic components.

## Application Colors

The application colors are used in multiple places in Ionic. These are useful for easily creating dark palettes or themes that match a brand.

It is important to note that the background and text color variables also require a rgb variable to be set in <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/RGB" target="_blank">rgb format</a>. See [The Alpha Problem](advanced.md#the-alpha-problem) for an explanation of why the `rgb` property is also needed.

| Name                                       | Description                                          |

| `--ion-background-color-rgb`               | Background color of the entire app, rgb format       |
| `--ion-text-color`                         | Text color of the entire app                         |
| `--ion-text-color-rgb`                     | Text color of the entire app, rgb format             |
| `--ion-backdrop-color`                     | Color of the Backdrop component                      |

| `--ion-tab-bar-border-color`               | Border color of the Tab Bar                          |
| `--ion-tab-bar-color`                      | Color of the Tab Bar                                 |
| `--ion-tab-bar-color-selected`             | Color of the selected Tab Button                     |

| `--ion-toolbar-segment-indicator-color`    | Color of the Segment Button indicator in the Toolbar |
| `--ion-item-background`                    | Background of the Item                               |
| `--ion-item-border-color`                  | Border color of the Item                             |
| `--ion-item-color`                         | Color of the components in the Item                  |
| `--ion-placeholder-color`                  | Color of the placeholder in Inputs                   |

## Stepped Colors

After exploring different ways to customize the Ionic theme, we found that we couldn't use just one background or text color. In order to imply importance and depth throughout the design, we need to use different shades of the background and text colors. To accommodate this pattern, we created stepped colors.

While updating the background (`--ion-background-color`) and text (`--ion-text-color`) variables will change the look of the app for most components, there are certain Ionic components where it may look off, or broken. This will be more apparent when applying a darker palette.

In some components we use a shade darker than the background or lighter than the text. For example, an item heading text may need to be <CodeColor color="#404040">#404040</CodeColor>, which is a few shades lighter than our default text color. Meanwhile, the loading component background is a shade darker than white, using <CodeColor color="#f2f2f2">#f2f2f2</CodeColor>. We use stepped colors in order to define these slight variations. It is important to update the stepped colors when updating the background or text color of an application.

Ionic provides separate step colors for text and background colors so they can be updated separately. This is useful for components that use both text and background stepped colors and allows us to effectively implement the [high contrast palette](./high-contrast-mode).

By default, the Ionic text stepped colors start at the default text color value <CodeColor color="#000000">#000000</CodeColor> and mix with the background color value <CodeColor color="#ffffff">#ffffff</CodeColor> using an increasing percentage. The Ionic background stepped colors start at the default background color value <CodeColor color="#ffffff">#ffffff</CodeColor> and mix with the text color value <CodeColor color="#000000">#000000</CodeColor> using an increasing percentage. The full list of stepped colors is shown in the generator below.

## Stepped Color Generator

Create a custom background and text color theme for your app. Update the background or text color’s hex values below, then copy and paste the generated code directly into your Ionic project.

<SteppedColorGenerator useTextAndBackgroundStepColors={true} />

</head>

## Common mistakes

### Forgetting Parentheses on a Decorator

Decorators should have parentheses `()` after an annotation. Some examples include: `@Injectable()`, `@Optional()`, `@Input()`, etc.

```tsx
@Directive({
  selector: 'my-dir',
})
class MyDirective {
  // Wrong, should be @Optional()
  // @Optional does nothing here, so MyDirective will error if parent is undefined
  constructor(@Optional parent: ParentComponent) {}
}
```

## Common Errors

### Cannot Resolve all Parameters

```shell
Cannot resolve all parameters for 'YourClass'(?). Make sure that all the parameters are decorated with Inject or have valid type annotations and that 'YourClass' is decorated with Injectable.
```

This exception means that Angular is confused about one or more of the parameters for `YourClass`'s constructor. In order to do [dependency injection](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/dependency-injection.html) Angular needs to know the type of the parameter to inject. You let Angular know this by specifying the class of the parameter. Make sure:

- You are importing the parameter's class.
- You have properly annotated the parameter or specified its type.

```tsx
import { MyService } from 'my-service'; // Don't forget to import me!

@Component({
  template: `Hello World`,
})
export class MyClass {
  // service is of type MyService
  constructor(service: MyService) {}
}
```

Sometimes circular references within your code can cause this error. Circular references mean that two objects depend on each other, and so there is no way to declare both of them before each other. To get around this, we can use the [`forwardRef`](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/api/core/index/forwardRef-function.html) function built in to Angular.

```ts
import { forwardRef } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'my-button',
  template: `<div>
    <icon></icon>
    <input type="button" />
  </div>`,
  directives: [forwardRef(() => MyIcon)], // MyIcon has not been defined yet
}) // forwardRef resolves as MyIcon when MyIcon is needed
class MyButton {
  constructor() {}
}

@Directive({
  selector: 'icon',
})
class MyIcon {
  constructor(containerButton: MyButton) {} // MyButton has been defined
}
```

### No provider for ParamType

```shell
No provider for ParamType! (MyClass -> ParamType)
```

This means Angular knows the type of parameter it is supposed to inject, but it doesn't know how to inject it.

If the parameter is a service, make sure you have added the specified class to the list of providers available to your app:

```tsx
import { MyService } from 'my-service';

@Component({
  templateUrl: 'app/app.html',
  providers: [MyService], // Don't forget me!
})
class MyApp {}
```

If the parameter is another component or directive (for example, a parent component), adding it to your list of providers will make the error go away, but this will have the same effect as the [Multiple instances of a provider](#multiple_instances) above. You'll be creating a new instance of the component class, and you won't get a reference to the component instance you want. Instead, make sure that the directive or component you expect to be injected is available to your component (e.g. that it is actually a parent if you are expecting it to be a parent). This is probably easiest understood with an example:

```tsx
@Component({
  selector: 'my-comp',
  template: '<p my-dir></p>',
  directives: [forwardRef(() => MyDir)],
})
class MyComp {
  constructor() {
    this.name = 'My Component';
  }
}

@Directive({
  selector: '[my-dir]',
})
class MyDir {
  constructor(c: MyComp) {
    // <-- This is the line of interest

    // Errors when directive is on regular div because there is no MyComp in the
    // component tree so there is no MyComp to inject
    console.log("Host component's name: " + c.name);
  }
}

@Component({
  template:
    '<my-comp></my-comp>' + // No error in MyDir constructor, MyComp is parent of MyDir
    '<my-comp my-dir></my-comp>' + // No error in MyDir constructor, MyComp is host of MyDir
    '<div my-dir></div>', // Errors in MyDir constructor
  directives: [MyComp, MyDir],
})
class MyApp {}
```

Here's a diagram illustrating what injectors are available:

```
                 +-------+
                 |  App  |
                 +---+---+
                     |
       +-------------+------------+
       |                          |
+------+------+          +--------+--------+
| Div (MyDir) |          | MyComp (MyDir)  |  <- MyComp can be injected
+-------------+          +--------+--------+
       ^                          |
No MyComp to inject        +------+------+
                           | P (MyDir)   | <- MyComp can be injected from parent
                           +-------------+
```

To expand on the previous example, you can use the Angular `@Optional` annotation if you don't always expect a component/directive reference:

```tsx
@Directive({
  selector: '[my-dir]',
})
class MyDir {
  constructor(@Optional() c: MyComp) {
    // No longer errors if c is undefined
    if (c) {
      console.log(`Host component's name: ${c.name}`);
    }
  }
}
```

### Can't bind to 'propertyName' since it isn't a known property

```shell
Can't bind to 'propertyName' since it isn't a known property of the 'elementName' element and there are no matching directives with a corresponding property
```

This happens when you try and bind a property on an element that doesn't have that property. If the element is a component or has one or more directives on it, neither the component nor the directives have that property either.

```html
<!-- div doesn't have a 'foo' property -->
<div [foo]="bar"></div>
```

### No provider for ControlContainer

```shell
No provider for ControlContainer! (NgControlName -> ControlContainer)
```

This error is a more specific version of the `No provider` error above. It happens when you use a form control like NgControlName without specifying a parent [NgForm](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/api/forms/index/NgForm-directive.html) or NgFormModel. In most cases, this can be resolved by making sure your form control is within an actual form element. NgForm uses `form` as a selector so this will instantiate a new NgForm:

```tsx
@Component({
  template:
  '<form>' +
  '<input ngControl="login">' +
  '</form>'
})
```

### No Component Factory Found

```shell
No component factory found for <component name>
```

This error happens when you are trying to use a component, provider pipe or directive that has not been imported and added to your ngModule. Whenever you add a new component, provider, pipe or directive to your app, you must add it to the `ngModule` in the `src/app/app.module.ts` file for Angular to be able to use it. To fix this error you can import the offending component, provider, pipe or directive into the app.module file and then if it is a provider add it to the `providers` array and for a component, pipe or directive add it to both the declarations array and `entryComponents` array.

  <title>CORS Errors: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing - Ionic Documentation</title>
  <meta
    name="description"
    content="CORS errors happen in web apps if requests are made and servers don't return required headers. Read about Cross-Origin Resource Sharing in Ionic Documentation."
  />
</head>

## What is CORS?

**Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)** is a mechanism that browsers and webviews — like the ones powering Capacitor and Cordova — use to restrict HTTP and HTTPS requests made from scripts to resources in a different origin for security reasons, mainly to protect your user's data and prevent attacks that would compromise your app.

In order to know if an external origin supports CORS, the server has to send some [special headers](#cors-headers) for the browser to allow the requests.

An **origin** is the combination of the **protocol**, **domain**, and **port** from which your Ionic app or the external resource is served. For example, apps running in Capacitor have `capacitor://localhost` (iOS) or `http://localhost` (Android) as their origin.

When the origin where your app is served (e.g. `http://localhost:8100` with `ionic serve`) and the origin of the resource being requested (e.g. `https://api.example.com`) don't match, the browser's <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Same Origin Policy</a> takes effect and CORS is required for the request to be made.

CORS errors are common in web apps when a cross-origin request is made but the server doesn't return the required headers in the response (is not CORS-enabled):

:::note
XMLHttpRequest cannot load https://api.example.com. No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. Origin 'http://localhost:8100' is therefore not allowed access.
:::

## How does CORS work

### Request with preflight

By default, when a web app tries to make a cross-origin request the browser sends a **preflight request** before the actual request. This preflight request is needed in order to know if the external resource supports CORS and if the actual request can be sent safely, since it may impact user data.

A preflight request is sent by the browser if:

- **The method is:**
  - PUT
  - DELETE
  - CONNECT
  - OPTIONS
  - TRACE
  - PATCH
- **Or if it has a header other than:**
  - Accept
  - Accept-Language
  - Content-Language
  - Content-Type
  - DPR
  - Downlink
  - Save-Data
  - Viewport-Width
  - Width
- **Or if it has a `Content-Type` header other than:**
  - application/x-www-form-urlencoded
  - multipart/form-data
  - text/plain
- Or if a `ReadableStream` or event listeners in `XMLHttpRequestUpload` are used.

If any of the conditions above are met, a preflight request with the `OPTIONS` method is sent to the resource URL.

Let's suppose we are making a `POST` request to a fictional JSON API at `https://api.example.com` with a `Content-Type` of `application/json`. The preflight request would be like this (some default headers omitted for clarity):

```http
OPTIONS / HTTP/1.1
Host: api.example.com
Origin: http://localhost:8100
Access-Control-Request-Method: POST
Access-Control-Request-Headers: Content-Type
```

If the server is CORS enabled, it will parse the `Access-Control-Request-*` headers and understand that a `POST` request is trying to be made from `http://localhost:8100` with a custom `Content-Type`.

The server will then respond to this preflight with which origins, methods, and headers are allowed by using the `Access-Control-Allow-*` headers:

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://localhost:8100
Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, POST, OPTIONS
Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Content-Type
```

If the returned origin and method don't match the ones from the actual request, or any of the headers used are not allowed, the request will be blocked by the browser and an error will be shown in the console. Otherwise, the request will be made after the preflight.

In our example, since the API expects JSON, all `POST` requests will have a `Content-Type: application/json` header and always be preflighted.

### Simple requests

Some requests are always considered safe to send and don't need a preflight if they meet all of the following conditions:

- **The method is:**
  - GET
  - HEAD
  - POST
- **Have only these headers:**
  - Accept
  - Accept-Language
  - Content-Language
  - Content-Type
  - DPR
  - Downlink
  - Save-Data
  - Viewport-Width
  - Width
- **The `Content-Type` header is:**
  - application/x-www-form-urlencoded
  - multipart/form-data
  - text/plain
- No `ReadableStream` or event listeners in `XMLHttpRequestUpload` are used.

In our example API, `GET` requests don't need to be preflighted because no JSON data is being sent, and so the app doesn't need to use the `Content-Type: application/json` header. They will always be simple requests.

## CORS Headers

### Server Headers (Response)

| Header                           | Value             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Access-Control-Allow-Origin**  | `origin` or `*`   | Specifies the origin to be allowed, like `http://localhost:8100` or `*` to allow all origins.                                                                                              |
| **Access-Control-Allow-Methods** | `methods`         | Which methods are allowed when accessing the resource: `GET`, `HEAD`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, `CONNECT`, `OPTIONS`, `TRACE`, `PATCH`.                                                     |
| **Access-Control-Allow-Headers** | `headers`         | Used in response to a preflight request to indicate which headers can be used when making the actual request, aside from the [simple headers](#simple-requests), which are always allowed. |
| Access-Control-Allow-Credentials | `true` or `false` | Whether or not the request can be made with credentials.                                                                                                                                   |
| Access-Control-Expose-Headers    | `headers`         | Specifies the headers that the browser is allowed to access.                                                                                                                               |
| Access-Control-Max-Age           | `seconds`         | Indicates how long the results of a preflight request can be cached.                                                                                                                       |

### Browser Headers (Request)

The browser automatically sends the appropriate headers for CORS in every request to the server, including the preflight requests. Please note that the headers below are for reference only, and **should not be set in your app code** (the browser will ignore them).

#### All Requests

| Header     | Value    | Description                          |
| ---------- | -------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **Origin** | `origin` | Indicates the origin of the request. |

#### Preflight Requests

| Header                            | Value     | Description                                                                                       |
| --------------------------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Access-Control-Request-Method** | `method`  | Used to let the server know what method will be used when the actual request is made.             |
| Access-Control-Request-Headers    | `headers` | Used to let the server know what non-simple headers will be used when the actual request is made. |

## Solutions for CORS Errors

### A. Enabling CORS in a server you control

The correct and easiest solution is to enable CORS by returning the [right response headers](#server-headers-response-) from the web server or backend and responding to preflight requests, as it allows to keep using `XMLHttpRequest`, `fetch`, or abstractions like `HttpClient` in Angular.

Ionic apps may be run from different origins, but only one origin can be specified in the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header. Therefore we recommend checking the value of the `Origin` header from the request and reflecting it in the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header in the response.

Please note that all of the `Access-Control-Allow-*` headers have to be sent from the server, and don't belong in your app code.

Here are some of the origins your Ionic app may be served from:

#### Capacitor

| Platform | Origin                  |
| -------- | ----------------------- |
| iOS      | `capacitor://localhost` |
| Android  | `http://localhost`      |

Replace `localhost` with your own hostname if you have changed the default in the Capacitor config.

#### Ionic WebView 3.x plugin on Cordova

| Platform | Origin              |
| -------- | ------------------- |
| iOS      | `ionic://localhost` |
| Android  | `http://localhost`  |

Replace `localhost` with your own hostname if you have changed the default in the plugin config.

#### Ionic WebView 2.x plugin on Cordova

| Platform | Origin                  |
| -------- | ----------------------- |
| iOS      | `http://localhost:8080` |
| Android  | `http://localhost:8080` |

Replace port `8080` with your own if you have changed the default in the plugin config.

#### Local development in the browser

| Command                       | Origin                                                   |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ionic serve`                 | `http://localhost:8100` or `http://YOUR_MACHINE_IP:8100` |
| `npm run start` or `ng serve` | `http://localhost:4200` for Ionic Angular apps.          |

Port numbers can be higher if you are serving multiple apps at the same time.

Allowing any origin with `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` is guaranteed to work in all scenarios but may have security implications — like some CSRF attacks — depending on how the server controls access to resources and use sessions and cookies.

For more information on how to enable CORS in different web and app servers, please check <a href="https://enable-cors.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">enable-cors.org</a>

CORS can be easily enabled in Express/Connect apps with the <a href="https://github.com/expressjs/cors" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cors</a> middleware:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const cors = require('cors');
const app = express();

const allowedOrigins = [
  'capacitor://localhost',
  'ionic://localhost',
  'http://localhost',
  'http://localhost:8080',
  'http://localhost:8100',
];

// Reflect the origin if it's in the allowed list or not defined (cURL, Postman, etc.)
const corsOptions = {
  origin: (origin, callback) => {
    if (allowedOrigins.includes(origin) || !origin) {
      callback(null, true);
    } else {
      callback(new Error('Origin not allowed by CORS'));
    }
  },
};

// Enable preflight requests for all routes
app.options('*', cors(corsOptions));

app.get('/', cors(corsOptions), (req, res, next) => {
  res.json({ message: 'This route is CORS-enabled for an allowed origin.' });
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('CORS-enabled web server listening on port 3000');
});
```

### B. Working around CORS in a server you can't control

#### Don't leak your keys!

If you are trying to connect to a 3rd-party API, first check in its documentation that is safe to use it directly from the app (client-side) and that it won't leak any secret/private keys or credentials, as it's easy to see them in clear text in Javascript code. Many APIs don't support CORS on purpose, in order to force developers to use them in the server and protect important information or keys.

#### 1. Native-only apps (iOS/Android)

##### Capacitor Applications (Recommended)

For Capacitor applications, use the [Capacitor HTTP API](https://capacitorjs.com/docs/apis/http). This API patches `fetch` and `XMLHttpRequest` to use native libraries. Please note that if you also deploy the application to a web-based context such as PWA or the local development server (via `ionic serve` for example) you still need to implement CORS for those scenarios.

##### Legacy Cordova Applications

For legacy Cordova applications, use the [HTTP plugin with the Awesome Cordova Plugins wrapper](https://danielsogl.gitbook.io/awesome-cordova-plugins/http). Please note that this plugin doesn't work in the browser, so the development and testing of the app must always be done in a device or simulator going forward.

```tsx
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { HTTP } from '@awesome-cordova-plugins/http/ngx';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-home',
  templateUrl: './home.page.html',
  styleUrls: ['./home.page.scss'],
})
export class HomePage {
  constructor(private http: HTTP) {}

  async getData() {
    try {
      const url = 'https://api.example.com';
      const params = {};
      const headers = {};

      const response = await this.http.get(url, params, headers);

      console.log(response.status);
      console.log(JSON.parse(response.data)); // JSON data returned by server
      console.log(response.headers);
    } catch (error) {
      console.error(error.status);
      console.error(error.error); // Error message as string
      console.error(error.headers);
    }
  }
}
```

#### 2. Native + PWAs

Send the requests through an HTTP/HTTPS proxy that bypasses them to the external resources and adds the necessary CORS headers to the responses. This proxy must be trusted or under your control, as it will be intercepting most traffic made by the app.

Also, keep in mind that the browser or webview will not receive the original HTTPS certificates but the one being sent from the proxy if it's provided. URLs may need to be rewritten in your code in order to use the proxy.

Check <a href="https://github.com/Rob--W/cors-anywhere/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cors-anywhere</a> for a Node.js CORS proxy that can be deployed in your own server. Using free hosted CORS proxies in production is not recommended.

### C. Disabling CORS or browser web security

Please be aware that CORS exists for a reason (security of user data and to prevent attacks against your app). **It's not possible or advisable to try to disable CORS**.

Older webviews like `UIWebView` on iOS don't enforce CORS but are deprecated and are very likely to disappear soon. Modern webviews like iOS `WKWebView` or Android `WebView` (both used by Capacitor) do enforce CORS and provide huge security and performance improvements.

If you are developing a PWA or testing in the browser, using the `--disable-web-security` flag in Google Chrome or an extension to disable CORS is a really bad idea. You will be exposed to all kind of attacks, you can't ask your users to take the risk, and your app won't work once in production.

## Live Reload

Live Reload is useful for debugging native functionality (such as plugins) on device hardware. Rather than deploy a new native binary each time you make a code change, it reloads the browser (or WebView) when changes in the app are detected. [Learn more here](../cli/livereload.md).

## iOS and Safari

Safari can be used to debug an Ionic app on a connected iOS device or iOS simulator.

First, on the iOS device, enable **Web Inspector** from Settings > Safari > Advanced.

Next, open Safari on a Mac then enable **Show Develop menu in menu bar** under Safari > Preferences > Advanced.

Run the iOS simulator or connect your iOS device to your Mac, then run the Ionic app that you want to debug.

Within Safari, select **Develop** in the toolbar. In the dropdown menu options, you should see the name of your device and app. Hover over the app name and click on **localhost**. This will open a new window with the Safari Developer Tools - use them to inspect and debug the Ionic app running on your device.

## Android and Chrome

Use Google Chrome's DevTools to debug an app when it is running in the browser using the `ionic serve` command, deployed to an emulator, or on a physical device.

To inspect a physical device, first you need to have developer mode enabled. Connect your Android device to the computer then go to `Settings > About` scroll to `Build Number` and tap that 7 times. This will activate a new option in the **Settings** menu called **Developer Options**.

Next, go to `Settings > Developer Options` and ensure that the developer options switch is toggled on. Scroll down to **USB Debugging** and ensure that it is also enabled. Developer Options & USB Debugging are enabled by default in the Android emulator.

Open the Chrome browser and navigate to the URL `chrome://inspect/#devices`. Your connected Android device should show up in the list of Remote Targets.

On your device, open the Ionic app that you would like to debug using Chrome.

With your app running on the device, head back to Chrome and click on **inspect** under your device in the list of remote targets. This will open the Chrome Developer Tools in a new window. You will then be able to use all of the Chrome DevTools to debug the application as it runs on your device.

:::note
The app preview may not automatically appear when you open Chrome Developer Tools due to a minor bug. To make it appear, click on the **Elements** tab then click on any DOM element then toggle off and on any CSS rule and the app preview window will appear.
:::

## Debugging with Visual Studio locally in Chrome (both Android & iOS)

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) can also be used to debug an Ionic app running in the Chrome web browser.

To do this, run your app in the browser using `ionic serve`. Take note of the port that your app is running on. Next, open your Ionic project using Visual Studio Code.

In the far-left vertical menu within VS Code, click on the `run` icon. If you are configuring this for the first time in your project, click on the option to create a `launch.json` file. Select **Chrome** from the environment options dropdown. This will automatically generate a `launch.json` file with configurations for launching Chrome against localhost.

Make sure that the port used in the url property of your `launch.json` file matches the port that you observed earlier when you ran `ionic serve`. Using an incorrect port number will not work.

In the debug target dropdown menu, select **Launch against Chrome**, then click run. This will open a new instance of the Chrome browser and VS code will attach to it. You can set breakpoints and use the other debugging tools within VS Code while your app is running in Chrome.

## Debugging with Visual Studio Code in Android

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) has a dedicated plugin for debugging apps that run in an Android WebView.

[The plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mpotthoff.vscode-android-webview-debug) creates a bridge between the device and the Visual Studio Code developer tools and permits debugging right from the editor.

In order to use this plugin to debug your Ionic apps, first install it then start your app in the Android emulator or connect your Android device and run the app. You may need to enable USB debugging on your Android device.

In the root of your Ionic project, create a folder called `.vscode` and inside that folder create a file called `launch.json`. Inside `launch.json`, enter the following code to configure the plugin to debug Ionic apps:

```json
{
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "configurations": [
    {
      "type": "android-webview",
      "request": "attach",
      "name": "Attach to Android WebView",
      "webRoot": "${workspaceFolder}/www",
      "sourceMaps": true,
      "sourceMapPathOverrides": {
        "webpack:/*": "${workspaceFolder}/*"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Next, launch the debugging process, selecting your device and Ionic app. VS Code will attach to both the Android device and Ionic app and you can now debug your app, which includes setting breakpoints.

:::note
If you are unable to set breakpoints and get an error saying, **"Breakpoint ignored because generated code not found (source map problem?)"** it means that the paths to the transpiled javascript files are incorrect. Use the `.scripts` command in the Debug console to see the loaded scripts. Make sure the paths of the scripts are correct by experimenting with different values in the `sourceMapPathOverrides` key in your `launch.json` configuration file.

## Code Signing errors

```shell
Code Signing Error: Failed to create provisioning profile. The app ID "com.csform.ionic.yellow" cannot be registered to your development team. Change your bundle identifier to a unique string to try again. Code Signing Error: No profiles for 'com.csform.ionic.yellow' were found: Xcode couldn't find any iOS App Development provisioning profiles matching 'com.csform.ionic.yellow'. Code Signing Error: Code signing is required for product type 'Application' in SDK 'iOS 11.1'
```

Running an app on an iOS device requires a provisioning profile. If a provisioning profile has not been created yet follow these directions:

1. <strong>Set the [Package ID](../reference/glossary.md#package-id).</strong>

   For Capacitor, open the `capacitor.config.json` file and modify the `appId` property.

   For Cordova, open the `config.xml` file and modify the `id` attribute of the root element, `<widget>`. See [the Cordova documentation](https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/config_ref/#widget) for more information.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
2. <strong>Open the project in <b>Xcode</b>.</strong>

   For Capacitor, run the following to open the app in Xcode:

   ```shell
   $ ionic capacitor open ios
   ```

   For Cordova, open Xcode. Use **File** &raquo; **Open** and locate the app. Open the app's `platforms/ios` directory.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
3. <strong>In <b>Project navigator</b>, select the project root to open the project editor. Under the **Identity** section, verify that the Package ID that was set matches the Bundle Identifier.</strong>

   ![Xcode showing the Identity section for an iOS app with fields for Display Name, Bundle Identifier, Version, and Build.](/img/running/ios-xcode-identity-setup.png "Xcode Identity Section")

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
4. <strong>In the same project editor, under the <b>Signing</b> section, ensure <b>Automatically manage signing</b> is enabled.</strong> Then, select a Development Team. Given a Development Team, Xcode will attempt to automatically prepare provisioning and signing.

   ![Xcode showing the Signing section with 'Automatically manage signing' enabled and a Development Team selected.](/img/running/ios-xcode-signing-setup.png "Xcode Signing Section")

## Xcode build error 65

```shell
Error: Error code 65 for command: xcodebuild with args: -xcconfig,/Users/ionitron/projects/my-project/platforms/ios/cordova/build-debug.xcconfig,-workspace,SC project.xcworkspace,-scheme,SC project,-configuration,Debug,-sdk,iphonesimulator,-destination,platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone X,build,CONFIGURATION_BUILD_DIR=/Users/ionitron/projects/my-project/platforms/ios/build/emulator,SHARED_PRECOMPS_DIR=/Users/ionitron/projects/my-project/platforms/ios/build/sharedpch
```

This error is an error code from Xcode that can be caused by provisioning issues or outdated cordova dependencies. To fix this error first make sure a provisioning profile has been generated using the above instructions and then try to [run the app from Xcode](../developing/ios.md#running-with-xcode).

If this does not fix the error then run the following commands:

```shell
rm -rf node_modules
rm -rf platform
npm i
ionic cordova platform add ios
ionic cordova prepare ios
ionic cordova build ios --prod
```

Once these commands have been ran a fresh build can be done.

## Clashing Google Play Services versions

```shell
Error: more than one library with package name com.google.android.gms
```

This error is caused by two separate plugins trying to use different versions of the `Google Play Services`. To fix this issue make sure you are running `cordova` version `7.1.0` or higher and `cordova-android` `6.3.0` or higher. To install latest `cordova` run:

```shell
npm install cordova@latest
```

and to update `cordova-android` run:

```shell
cordova platform update android
```

Plugins that depend on `Google Play Services` can now be updated to use the same version. For example, if `pluginA` uses version 11.0 and `pluginB` uses version 15.0 they can be updated to use the same version with the following snippet in the `config.xml` file:

```xml
<plugin name="pluginA" spec="npm">
  <variable name="PLAY_SERVICES_VERSION" value="15.0.0"/>
</plugin>
<plugin name="pluginB" spec="npm">
  <variable name="PLAY_SERVICES_VERSION" value="15.0.0" />
</plugin>
```

## Blank App

:::note
I have no errors in my app. Why does it show a blank screen?
:::

There are several different reasons this can happen. If you are unable to find a solution on the [Ionic forums](https://forum.ionicframework.com), make sure:

- Polyfills are not included for older browser/versions of android

For projects with `@angular/cli@7.3` or above, polyfills will automatically be included. For project created before that, polyfills need to be manually enabled.

In `src/polyfills.ts`, you must enabled all ES6 polyfills for Android 4.4 support.

Alternatively, a project could be updated to use the latest release of the `@angular/cli` package & `@angular-devkit` packages and include the `es5BrowserSupport` option in the `angular.json`'s build options object:

```diff
        "input": "src/global.scss"
      }
    ],
-   "scripts": []
+   "scripts": [],
+   "es5BrowserSupport": true
  },
  "configurations": {
    "production": {
```

This will automatically include the polyfills for older browsers that need them.

## Directive Not Working

:::note
Why is my custom component/directive not working?
:::

There are a few things you can check. Make sure:

- Your selector doesn't have any misspellings.
- You're using the selector correctly as an attribute, element or class.
- Your selector has the proper syntax:
  - `[attr]` if it's an attribute selector
  - `element` if it's an element selector
  - `.class` if it's a class selector

Here's an example using an attribute selector:

```tsx
@Directive({
  selector: '[my-dir]' // <-- [my-dir] because it is an attribute
})                     // Could be my-dir, [my-dir], .my-dir
class MyDir {
  constructor() {
    console.log('I'm alive!');
  }
}

@Component({
  // We add my-dir as an attribute to match the directive's selector
  template: `<div my-dir>Hello World</div>`,

  // Alternatively, if you were attaching the directive to an element it would be:
  // template: `<my-dir>Hello World</my-dir>`
  // and if you were attaching by class the template would be:
  // template: `<div class="my-dir">Hello World</div>`

  directives: [MyDir] // <-- Don't forget me! (only if your ionic-angular version is below RC0)
})
class MyPage { }
```

## Click Delays

:::note
Why is there a delay on my click event?
:::

In general, we recommend only adding `(click)` events to elements that are
normally clickable. This includes `<button>` and `<a>` elements. This improves
accessibility as a screen reader will be able to tell that the element is
clickable.

However, you may need to add a `(click)` event to an element that is not
normally clickable. When you do this you may experience a `300ms` delay from the
time you click the element to the event firing. To remove this delay, you can
add the `tappable` attribute to your element.

```html
<div tappable (click)="doClick()">I am clickable!</div>
```

## Angular Change Detection

:::note
Why does Angular change detection run very frequently when my components are initializing?
:::

Angular uses a library called [zone.js](https://github.com/angular/angular/tree/master/packages/zone.js/)
which helps it determine when to run change detection.

As of zone.js `0.8.27`, certain APIs for Web Components also cause change
detection to run. This can have the undesirable side effect of your app
slowing down when a large number of components are initializing.

To prevent this from happening, the zone.js flag that manages this portion of
change detection can be disabled. In the `src` directory of your application,
create a file called `zone-flags.ts`. Place the following code into the file:

```tsx
(window as any).__Zone_disable_customElements = true;
```

The `zone-flags.ts` file then needs to be imported into your application's
`polyfills.ts` file. Be sure to import it _before_ `zone.js` is imported:

```tsx
...

import './zone-flags.ts';
import 'zone.js/dist/zone'; // Included with Angular CLI

...
```

This change will only affect applications that depend on zone.js `0.8.27` or
newer. Older versions will not be affected by this change.

:::note
This flag is automatically included when creating an Ionic app via
:::
the Ionic CLI.

## Cordova plugins not working in the browser

At some point in your development you may, try to call Cordova plugin, but get a
warning:

```shell
[Warning] Native: tried calling StatusBar.styleDefault, but Cordova is not
available. Make sure to include cordova.js or run in a device/simulator
(app.bundle.js, line 83388)
```

This happens when you try to call a native plugin, but Cordova isn't available.
Thankfully, Ionic Native will print out a nice warning, instead of an error.

In other cases where the plugin is not being used through Ionic Native, plugins
can print a much more obscure warning.

```shell
EXCEPTION: Error: Uncaught (in promise): TypeError: undefined is not an object
(evaluating 'navigator.camera.getPicture')
```

If this happens, test the plugin on a real device or simulator.

## Multiple instances of a provider

If you inject a provider in every component because you want it available to all
of them you will end up with multiple instances of the provider. You should
inject the provider once in the parent component if you want it to be available
to the child components.

```tsx
let id = 0;
export class MyService {
  id: number;

  constructor() {
    this.id = id++;
  }
}

@Component({
  selector: 'my-component',
  template: 'Hello World',
  providers: [MyService], // <-- Creates a new instance of MyService :(
}) // Unnecessary because MyService is in App's providers
class MyComp {
  // id is 1, s is a different MyService instance than MyApp
  constructor(s: MyService) {
    console.log('MyService id is: ' + s.id);
  }
}

@Component({
  template: '<my-component></my-component>',
  providers: [MyService], // MyService only needs to be here
  directives: [MyComp],
})
class MyApp {
  // id is 0
  constructor(s: MyService) {
    console.log('MyService id is: ' + s.id);
  }
}
```

<!-- This is referenced in Ionic Framework component documentation so we explicitly define the anchor so it remains consistent. -->

## Accessing `this` in a function callback returns `undefined` {#accessing-this}

Certain components, such as [counterFormatter on ion-input](../api/input#counterformatter) and [pinFormatter on ion-range](../api/input#pinformatter), allow developers to pass callbacks. It's important that you bind the correct `this` value if you plan to access `this` from within the context of the callback. You may need to access `this` when using Angular components or when using class components in React. There are two ways to bind `this`:

The first way to bind `this` is to use the `bind()` method on a function instance. If you want to pass a callback called `counterFormatterFn`, then you would write `counterFormatterFn.bind(this)`.

The second way to bind `this` is to use an [arrow function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions) when defining the callback. This works because JavaScript does not create a new `this` binding for arrow functions.

See its [MDN page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this) for more information on how `this` works in JavaScript.

# Updating to Ionic 4

## Updating from Ionic 3 to 4

:::note
This guide assumes that you have already updated your app to the latest version of Ionic 3. If you are using Ionic 1 or 2, Make sure to follow the [Updating from Ionic 1 to 4 Guide](#updating-from-ionic-1-to-4) instead.
:::

:::info Breaking Changes
For a **complete list of breaking changes** from Ionic 3 to Ionic 4, please refer to [the breaking changes document](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-framework/blob/main/BREAKING_ARCHIVE/v4.md) in the Ionic Framework repository.
:::

We suggest the following general process when migrating an existing application from Ionic 3 to 4:

1. Generate a new project using the `blank` starter (see [Starting an App](../developing/starting.md))
1. Copy any Angular services from `src/providers` to `src/app/services`
   - Services should include `{ providedIn: 'root' }` in the `@Injectable()` decorator. For details, please see Angular [provider docs](https://angular.io/guide/providers).
1. Copy the app's other root-level items (pipes, components, etc) keeping in mind that the directory structure changes from `src/components` to `src/app/components`, etc.
1. Copy global Sass styling from `src/app/app.scss` to `src/global.scss`
1. Copy the rest of the application, page by page or feature by feature, keeping the following items in mind:
   - Emulated Shadow DOM is turned on by default
   - Page/component Sass should no longer be wrapped in the page/component tag and should use Angular's [`styleUrls`](https://angular.io/api/core/Component#styleUrls) option of the `@Component` decorator
   - RxJS has been updated from v5 to v6 (see [RxJS Changes](#rxjs-changes))
   - Certain lifecycle hooks should be replaced by Angular's hooks (see [Lifecycle Events](#lifecycle-events))
   - Markup changes may be required (migration tool available, see [Markup Changes](#markup-changes))

In many cases, using the Ionic CLI to generate a new object and then copying the code also works very well. For example: `ionic g service weather` will create a shell `Weather` service and test. The code can then be copied from the older project with minor modifications as needed. This helps to ensure the proper structure is followed. This also generates shells for unit tests.

### Changes in Package Name

In Ionic 4, the package name is `@ionic/angular`. Uninstall Ionic 3 and install Ionic 4 using the new package name:

```shell
$ npm uninstall ionic-angular
$ npm install @ionic/angular@v4-lts
```

While migrating an app, update the imports from `ionic-angular` to `@ionic/angular`.

### Project structure

One of the major changes between an Ionic 3 app and an Ionic 4 app is the overall project layout and structure. In v3, Ionic apps had a custom convention for how an app should be set up and what that folder structure should look like. In v4, this has been changed to follow the recommended setup of each supported framework.

For example, if an app is using Angular, that project structure will be exactly what an Angular CLI app would be. This change, while not too difficult to accommodate, helps to keep common patterns and documentation consistent.

````mdx-code-block
<Tabs
  defaultValue="v4"
  values={[
    { value: 'v4', label: 'Ionic 4' },
    { value: 'v3', label: 'Ionic 3' },

└── service-worker.js
.gitignore
ionic.config.json
package.json
tsconfig.json
tslint.json
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>
````

The above comparison is an example of a v4 app's project structure. For developers with experience in a vanilla Angular project, this should feel really familiar.

There is a `src/` directory that acts as the home for the app. This includes the `index.html`, any assets, environment configuration, and any app-specific config files.

While migrating an app to take advantage of this new layout, it is suggested that a new project "base" is made with the CLI. Then, with the new project layout, migrate the features of the app piece by piece. Pages/components/etc. should be moved into the `src/app/` folder.

Ensure your Ionic configuration file has the appropriate `type`. The project type for v3 is `ionic-angular`. The project type for v4 is `angular`. If this value is incorrect, the CLI may invoke the incorrect build scripts.

See the following `ionic.config.json` as an example:

```json
{
  "name": "my-app",
  "type": "angular"
}
```

### RxJS Changes

Between V3 and V4, RxJS was updated to version 6. This changes many of the import paths of operators and core RxJS functions. Please see the <a href="https://github.com/ReactiveX/rxjs/blob/6.x/docs_app/content/guide/v6/migration.md" target="_blank">RxJS Migration Guide</a> for details.

### Lifecycle Events

With V4, we're now able to utilize the typical events provided by [Angular](https://angular.io/guide/lifecycle-hooks). But for certain cases, you might want to have access to the events fired when a component has finished animating during its route change. In this case, the `ionViewWillEnter`, `ionViewDidEnter`, `ionViewWillLeave`, and `ionViewDidLeave` have been ported over from V3. Use these events to coordinate actions with Ionic's own animations system.

Older events like `ionViewDidLoad`, `ionViewCanLeave`, and `ionViewCanEnter` have been removed, and the proper Angular alternatives should be used.

For more details, check out the [router-outlet docs](../api/router-outlet.md)

### Overlay Components

In prior versions of Ionic, overlay components such as Loading, Toast, or Alert were created synchronously. In Ionic v4, these components are all created asynchronously. As a result of this, the API is now promise-based.

```tsx
// v3
showAlert() {
  const alert = this.alertCtrl.create({
    message: "Hello There",
    subHeader: "I'm a subheader"
  });

  alert.present();
}
```

In v4, promises are used:

```tsx
showAlert() {
  this.alertCtrl.create({
    message: "Hello There",
    subHeader: "I'm a subheader"
  }).then(alert => alert.present());
}

// Or using async/await

async showAlert() {
  const alert = await this.alertCtrl.create({
    message: "Hello There",
    subHeader: "I'm a subheader"
  });

  await alert.present();
}
```

### Navigation

In V4, navigation received the most changes. Now, instead of using Ionic's own `NavController`, we integrate with the official Angular Router. This not only provides a consistent routing experience across apps, but is much more dependable. The Angular team has an <a href="http://angular.io/guide/router" target="_blank">excellent guide</a> on their docs site that covers the Router in great detail.

To provide the platform-specific animations that users are used to, we have created `ion-router-outlet` for Angular Apps. This behaves in a similar manner to Angular's `router-outlet` but provides a stack-based navigation (tabs) and animations.

For a detailed explanation in navigation works in a V4 project, check out the [Angular navigation guide](../angular/navigation.md).

### Lazy Loading

Since Navigation has changed, the mechanism for lazy loading has also changed in V4.

In v3, a typical lazy loading setup worked like this:

```tsx
// home.page.ts
@IonicPage({
  segment: 'home'
})
@Component({ ... })
export class HomePage {}

// home.module.ts
@NgModule({
  declarations: [HomePage],
  imports: [IonicPageModule.forChild(HomePage)]
})
export class HomePageModule {}
```

However, in v4, lazy loading is done via the `loadChildren` method of the Angular router:

```tsx
// home.module.ts
@NgModule({
  imports: [IonicModule, RouterModule.forChild([{ path: '', component: HomePage }])],
  declarations: [HomePage],
})
export class HomePageModule {}

// app.module.ts
@NgModule({
  declarations: [AppComponent],
  imports: [
    BrowserModule,
    IonicModule.forRoot(),
    RouterModule.forRoot([
      { path: 'home', loadChildren: './pages/home/home.module#HomePageModule' },
      { path: '', redirectTo: 'home', pathMatch: 'full' },
    ]),
  ],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

For a detailed explanation of lazy loading in V4 project, check out the [Angular navigation guide](../angular/navigation.md#lazy-loading-routes).

### Markup Changes

Since v4 moved to Custom Elements, there's been a significant change to the markup for each component. These changes have all been made to follow the Custom Elements spec, and have been documented in a <a href="https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic/blob/master/angular/BREAKING.md#breaking-changes" target="_blank">dedicated file on GitHub</a>.

To help with these markup changes, we've released a TSLint-based <a href="https://github.com/ionic-team/v4-migration-tslint" target="_blank">Migration Tool</a>, which detects issues and can even fix some of them automatically.

## Updating from Ionic 1 to 4

### Ionic 1 to Ionic 4: What’s Involved?

Migrating from Ionic 1 to Ionic 4 involves moving from AngularJS (aka Angular 1) to Angular 7+. There are many architectural differences between these versions, so some of the app code will have to be rewritten. The amount of work involved depends on the complexity and size of your app.

One upside is that for the most part, the Ionic UI components you know and love from V1 haven’t changed much.

Here are some considerations to review before beginning the upgrade:

- **App complexity**: Naturally, the larger and more complex the app is, the longer it will take to migrate.
- **Framework support**: In 2019, Ionic will release full support for React. You can also use Ionic Framework components [without a framework](../intro/cdn.md). Since these are not production-ready yet, we recommend sticking with Angular or waiting until the other framework support is available.
- **Budget and team makeup**: The length of a migration project will vary based on the size of your team, the complexity of the app, and the amount of time allotted to make the transition.

### Suggested Strategy

Once your development team has identified a good time frame for beginning the migration, Ionic recommends feature-freezing the Ionic 1 application and getting the code in order: Fix any major bugs, eliminate tech debt, and reorganize as you see fit. Then, identify which features to migrate over and which to abandon.

Once the Ionic 1 app is stable, create a new Ionic 4 project. The majority of the dev team’s attention should be given to the new project; only bugs should be fixed in the Ionic 1 app to ensure that the transition happens as quickly and smoothly as possible.

Once the team is comfortable that the Ionic 4 app has become stable and has fulfilled a core set of features, you can then shut down the Ionic 1 app.

### Moving From AngularJS to Angular

Please reference official [Angular upgrade guide](https://angular.io/guide/upgrade) information.

### Ionic Changes

Our Ionic 3 to Ionic 4 migration sections above may prove to be a useful reference. Generate a new Ionic 4 project using the blank starter (see [Starting an App](../developing/starting.md)). Spend time getting familiar with Ionic 4 components. Happy building!

### Need Assistance?

# Updating from Ionic 5 to 6

:::note
This guide assumes that you have already updated your app to the latest version of Ionic 5. Make sure you have followed the [Updating to Ionic 5 Guide](./5-0) before starting this guide.
:::

:::info Breaking Changes
For a **complete list of breaking changes** from Ionic 5 to Ionic 6, please refer to [the breaking changes document](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-framework/blob/main/BREAKING_ARCHIVE/v6.md) in the Ionic Framework repository.
:::

## Getting Started

### Angular

1. Ionic 6 supports Angular 12+. Update to the latest version of Angular by following the [Angular Update Guide](https://update.angular.io/).
2. Update to the latest version of Ionic 6:

```shell
npm install @ionic/angular@6
```

If you are using Ionic Angular Server, be sure to update that as well:

```shell
npm install @ionic/angular@6 @ionic/angular-server@6
```

3. Remove any usage of `Config.set()`. Instead, set your config in `IonicModule.forRoot()`. See the [Angular Config Documentation](../developing/config) for more examples.
4. Remove any usage of the `setupConfig` function previously exported from `@ionic/angular`. Set your config in `IonicModule.forRoot()` instead.

### React

1. Ionic 6 supports React 17+. Update to the latest version of React:

```shell
npm install react@latest react-dom@latest
```

2. Update to the latest version of Ionic 6:

```shell
npm install @ionic/react@6 @ionic/react-router@6
```

3. Update the `test` field in the `scripts` object of your `package.json` to include `transformIgnorePatterns`:

```json
"scripts": {
  "test": "react-scripts test --transformIgnorePatterns 'node_modules/(?!(@ionic/react|@ionic/react-router|@ionic/core|@stencil/core|ionicons)/)'",
  ...
}
```

4. Import and call `setupIonicReact` in your `App` component file. If you are also using `setupConfig`, pass your config to `setupIonicReact` instead:

**Before**

```tsx title="App.tsx"
import { setupConfig } from '@ionic/react';

...

setupConfig({
  mode: 'md'
});
```

**After**

```tsx title="App.tsx"
import { setupIonicReact } from '@ionic/react';

...

setupIonicReact({
  mode: 'md'
});
```

:::note
Developers must import and call `setupIonicReact` even if they are not setting custom config.
:::

See the [React Config Documentation](../developing/config) for more examples.

5. Update all controller imports from `@ionic/core` to `@ionic/core/components`. As an example, here is a migration for `menuController`:

**Before**

```tsx
import { menuController } from '@ionic/core';
```

**After**

```tsx
import { menuController } from '@ionic/core/components';
```

### Vue

1. Ionic 6 supports Vue 3.0.6+. Update to the latest version of Vue:

```shell
npm install vue@3 vue-router@4
```

2. For apps that use the Vue CLI, install Vue CLI 5:

```shell
npm install -g @vue/cli@next
```

Then, upgrade all Vue CLI plugins:

```shell
vue upgrade --next
```

3. Update to the latest version of Ionic 6:

```shell
npm install @ionic/vue@6 @ionic/vue-router@6
```

4. Add the following `transformIgnorePatterns` to either `jest.config.js` or the `jest` field in `package.json`:

```js title="jest.config.js"
module.exports = {
  ...
  transformIgnorePatterns: ['/node_modules/(?!@ionic/vue|@ionic/vue-router|@ionic/core|@stencil/core|ionicons)']
}
```

```json title="package.json"
  {
    ...
    "jest": {
      "transformIgnorePatterns": ["/node_modules/(?!@ionic/vue|@ionic/vue-router|@ionic/core|@stencil/core|ionicons)"]
    }
  }
```

See the [Testing section below](#testing) for more information.

5. Remove any usage of the `setupConfig` function previously exported from `@ionic/vue`. Set your config when installing the `IonicVue` plugin instead. See the [Vue Config Documentation](../developing/config) for more examples.

6. Rename the `IonRouter` type for `useIonRouter` to `UseIonRouterResult`.

7. Rename the `IonKeyboardRef` type for `useKeyboard` to `UseKeyboardResult`.

8. Rename any overlay event listeners to use the new format:

**Before**

```html
<ion-modal
  :is-open="modalOpenRef"
  @onWillPresent="onModalWillPresentHandler"
  @onDidPresent="onModalDidPresentHandler"
  @onWillDismiss="onModalWillDismissHandler"
  @onDidDismiss="onModalDidDismissHandler"
>
  ...
</ion-modal>
```

**After**

```html
<ion-modal
  :is-open="modalOpenRef"
  @willPresent="onModalWillPresentHandler"
  @didPresent="onModalDidPresentHandler"
  @willDismiss="onModalWillDismissHandler"
  @didDismiss="onModalDidDismissHandler"
>
  ...
</ion-modal>
```

:::note
This applies to `ion-action-sheet`, `ion-alert`, `ion-loading`, `ion-modal`, `ion-picker`, `ion-popover`, and `ion-toast`.
:::

9. Pass in an `ion-router-outlet` into any `ion-tabs` that are being used:

**Before**

```html
<ion-tabs>
  <ion-tab-bar slot="bottom"> ... </ion-tab-bar>
</ion-tabs>

<script setup lang="ts">
  import { IonTabs, IonTabBar } from '@ionic/vue';
</script>
```

**After**

```html
<ion-tabs>
  <ion-router-outlet></ion-router-outlet>
  <ion-tab-bar slot="bottom"> ... </ion-tab-bar>
</ion-tabs>

<script setup lang="ts">
  import { IonTabs, IonTabBar, IonRouterOutlet } from '@ionic/vue';
</script>
```

10. Additional routes inside of tabs should be re-written as sibling routes instead of child routes:

**Before**

```ts
const routes: Array<RouteRecordRaw> = [
  {
    path: '/',
    redirect: '/tabs/tab1'
  },
  {
    path: '/tabs/',
    component: Tabs,
    children: [
      {
        path: '',
        redirect: 'tab1'
      },
      {
        path: 'tab1',
        component: () => import('@/views/Tab1.vue'),
        children: {
          {
            path: 'view',
            component: () => import('@/views/Tab1View.vue')
          }
        }
      },
      {
        path: 'tab2',
        component: () => import('@/views/Tab2.vue')
      },
      {
        path: 'tab3',
        component: () => import('@/views/Tab3.vue')
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

**After**

```ts
const routes: Array<RouteRecordRaw> = [
  {
    path: '/',
    redirect: '/tabs/tab1',
  },
  {
    path: '/tabs/',
    component: Tabs,
    children: [
      {
        path: '',
        redirect: 'tab1',
      },
      {
        path: 'tab1',
        component: () => import('@/views/Tab1.vue'),
      },
      {
        path: 'tab1/view',
        component: () => import('@/views/Tab1View.vue'),
      },
      {
        path: 'tab2',
        component: () => import('@/views/Tab2.vue'),
      },
      {
        path: 'tab3',
        component: () => import('@/views/Tab3.vue'),
      },
    ],
  },
];
```

### Core

1. Update to the latest version of Ionic 6:

```shell
npm install @ionic/core@6
```

## Updating Your Code

### Datetime

1. Remove any usages of the `placeholder`, `pickerOptions`, `pickerFormat`, `monthNames`, `monthShortNames`, `dayNames`, and `dayShortNames` properties. `ion-datetime` now automatically formats the month names, day names, and time displayed inside of the component according to the language and region set on the device. See the [ion-datetime Localization Documentation](../api/datetime#localization) for more information.

2. Remove any usages of the `text` and `placeholder` CSS Shadow Parts.

3. Remove any usages of the `--padding-bottom`, `--padding-end`, `--padding-start`, `--padding-top`, and `--placeholder-color` CSS Variables. To customize the padding on `ion-datetime`, you can use any of the `padding` CSS properties.

4. Remove any usage of the `open` method. To present the datetime in an overlay, place it inside of an `ion-modal` or an `ion-popover` component. See the [ion-datetime Usage Examples](../api/datetime#usage) for more information.

5. Remove any usage of the `displayFormat` or `displayTimezone` properties. To parse the UTC string provided in the payload of the `ionChange` event, we recommend using [date-fns](https://date-fns.org/). See the [ion-datetime Parsing Dates Documentation](../api/datetime#parsing-dates) for examples.

:::note
See the [Datetime Migration Sample Application](https://github.com/ionic-team/datetime-migration-samples) for more migration examples.
:::

### Icon

Ionic 6 now ships with Ionicons 6. Review the [Ionicons 6 Breaking Changes Guide](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionicons/releases/tag/v6.0.0) and make any necessary changes.

### Input

Ensure `null` is not passed in as a value to the `placeholder` property. We recommend using `undefined` instead.

### Modal

`ion-modal` now uses the Shadow DOM. Update any styles targeting the internals of `ion-modal` to use either the [ion-modal CSS Variables](../api/modal#css-custom-properties) or the [ion-modal CSS Shadow Parts](../api/modal#css-shadow-parts):

**Before**

```css
ion-modal .modal-wrapper {
  /* Any custom styles here */
}

ion-modal ion-backdrop {
  /* Any custom styles here */
}
```

**After**

```css
ion-modal::part(content) {
  /* Any custom styles here */
}

ion-modal::part(backdrop) {
  /* Any custom styles here */
}
```

### Popover

`ion-popover` now uses the Shadow DOM. Update any styles targeting the internals of `ion-popover` to use either [ion-popover CSS Variables](../api/popover#css-custom-properties) or the [ion-popover CSS Shadow Parts](../api/popover#css-shadow-parts):

**Before**

```css
ion-popover .popover-arrow {
  /* Any custom styles here */
}

ion-popover ion-backdrop {
  /* Any custom styles here */
}

ion-popover .popover-content {
  /* Any custom styles here */
}
```

**After**

```css
ion-popover::part(arrow) {
  /* Any custom styles here */
}

ion-popover::part(backdrop) {
  /* Any custom styles here */
}

ion-popover::part(content) {
  /* Any custom styles here */
}
```

### Radio

Remove any usage of the `RadioChangeEventDetail` interface.

### Select

Ensure `null` is not passed in as a value to the `placeholder` property. We recommend using `undefined` instead.

### Textarea

Ensure `null` is not passed in as a value to the `placeholder` property. We recommend using `undefined` instead.

### Browser Support

The list of browsers that Ionic supports has changed. Review the [Browser Support Guide](../reference/browser-support) to ensure you are deploying apps to supported browsers.

If you have a `browserslist` or `.browserslistrc` file, update it with the following content:

```
Chrome >=60
Firefox >=63
Edge >=79
Safari >=13
iOS >=13
```

### Testing

Ionic 6 now ships as ES Modules. ES Modules are supported in all major browsers and bring developer experience and code maintenance improvements. Developers testing with Jest will need to update their Jest configuration as Jest does not have full support for ES Modules as of Jest 27.

This update involves using Babel to compile Ionic's ES Modules down to the CommonJS (CJS) format, a format that Jest can understand. Once Jest ships support for ES Modules, this change will no longer be necessary. See https://github.com/facebook/jest/issues/9430 for updates on ES Modules support in Jest.

If you are starting fresh with a new Ionic app, this configuration is done for you in our starter applications. For those with existing Ionic apps, follow the steps below to get Jest working with Ionic 6:

1. Add a `transformIgnorePatterns` field to your Jest config that includes the relevant Ionic packages. This is typically found in `jest.config.js` or the `jest` field in `package.json`:

```js title="jest.config.js"
module.exports = {
  ...
  transformIgnorePatterns: ['/node_modules/(?!@ionic/core|@stencil/core|ionicons)']
}
```

```json title="package.json"
  {
    ...
    "jest": {
      "transformIgnorePatterns": ["/node_modules/(?!@ionic/core|@stencil/core|ionicons)"]
    }
  }
```

:::note
If you are using Ionic React or Ionic Vue, be sure to add the appropriate packages to the `transformIgnorePatterns` array. For Ionic React this includes `@ionic/react` and `@ionic/react-router`. For Ionic Vue this includes `@ionic/vue` and `@ionic/vue-router`.
:::

For developers using Create React App (CRA), there is currently no way to update the `transformIgnorePatterns` in a Jest config file. This is a CRA restriction and not something Ionic has control over. We can, however, pass the `transformIgnorePatterns` directly into the `react-scripts test` command:

```json title="package.json"
"scripts": {
  "test": "react-scripts test --transformIgnorePatterns 'node_modules/(?!(@ionic/react|@ionic/react-router|@ionic/core|@stencil/core|ionicons)/)'",
  ...
}
```

If you are still running into issues, here are a couple things to try:

1. Verify that `@babel/preset-env` is included in your [project-wide configuration](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/config-files#project-wide-configuration) instead of your [file-relative configuration](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/config-files#file-relative-configuration). This typically means defining the Babel configuration in `<project-root>/babel.config.json`.

2. If you have a `browserslist/test` field in `package.json` file, make sure it is set to `current node`.

# Updating from Ionic 6 to 7

:::note
This guide assumes that you have already updated your app to the latest version of Ionic 6. Make sure you have followed the [Upgrading to Ionic 6 Guide](./6-0) before starting this guide.
:::

:::info Breaking Changes
For a **complete list of breaking changes** from Ionic 6 to Ionic 7, please refer to [the breaking changes document](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-framework/blob/main/BREAKING.md#version-7x) in the Ionic Framework repository.
:::

## Getting Started

### Angular

1. Ionic 7 supports Angular 14+. Update to the latest version of Angular by following the [Angular Update Guide](https://update.angular.io/).
2. If your project is using rxjs, Ionic 7 requires a minimum rxjs version of 7.5.0:

```shell
npm install rxjs@7.5.0
```

3. Update to the latest version of Ionic 7:

```shell
npm install @ionic/angular@7
```

If you are using Ionic Angular Server and Ionic Angular Toolkit, be sure to update those as well:

```shell
npm install @ionic/angular@7 @ionic/angular-server@7 @ionic/angular-toolkit@9
```

> Note: `@ionic/angular-toolkit@9` requires a minimum of Angular 15. If you are still on Angular 14, then you can skip updating to `@ionic/angular-toolkit@9`.

### React

1. Ionic 7 supports React 17+. Update to the latest version of React:

```shell
npm install react@latest react-dom@latest
```

2. Update to the latest version of Ionic 7:

```shell
npm install @ionic/react@7 @ionic/react-router@7
```

### Vue

1. Ionic 7 supports Vue 3.0.6+. Update to the latest version of Vue:

```shell
npm install vue@latest vue-router@latest
```

3. Update to the latest version of Ionic 7:

```shell
npm install @ionic/vue@7 @ionic/vue-router@7
```

### Core

1. Update to the latest version of Ionic 7:

```shell
npm install @ionic/core@7
```

## Updating Your Code

### Browser Support

The list of browsers that Ionic supports has changed. Review the [Browser Support Guide](../reference/browser-support) to ensure you are deploying apps to supported browsers.

If you have a `browserslist` or `.browserslistrc` file, update it with the following content:

```
Chrome >=79
ChromeAndroid >=79
Firefox >=70
Edge >=79
Safari >=14
iOS >=14
```

### Types

1. `ActionSheetAttributes`, `AlertAttributes`, `AlertTextareaAttributes`, `AlertInputAttributes`, `LoadingAttributes`, `ModalAttributes`, `PickerAttributes`, `PopoverAttributes`, and `ToastAttributes` have been removed. Developers should use `{ [key: string]: any }` instead.

### Checkbox

1. Rename any usages of the `--background` and `--background-checked` CSS Variables to `--checkbox-background` and `--checkbox-background-checked`, respectively.

### Datetime

1. Remove any code that sets the `value` property to the empty string (`''`).
2. Remove any code that accesses the time zone information on the `value` property. Datetime does not manage time zones, so any time zone information provided is ignored.

### Input

1. Update any code that accesses the `detail` payload for the `ionInput` event from `event.detail` to `event.detail.value` as the detail payload is now an object containing a value and an event.

### Modal

1. Remove any usage of the `swipeToClose` property. Card modals are swipeable by default, so you can remove `swipeToClose` if you want your card modal to remain swipeable. Use the [canDismiss](https://ionicframework.com/docs/api/modal#preventing-a-modal-from-dismissing) property if you want to prevent a modal from dismissing.
2. Remove any code that sets the `canDismiss` property to `undefined`. The `canDismiss` property now defaults to `true`, so this code is no longer needed.

### Picker

1. Remove any code that accesses `refresh` on `ion-picker-column`. Developers should use the `columns` property on `ion-picker` to refresh the view instead.

### Searchbar

1. Update any code that accesses the `detail` payload for the `ionInput` event from `event.detail` to `event.detail.value` as the detail payload is now an object containing a value and an event.

### Segment

1. Remove any code that sets the `value` property to `null`. Developers should use either `''` or `undefined` instead.

### Slides

1. Remove `ion-slides`, `ion-slide`, and any associated types. These components have been removed in favor of using Swiper.js directly. The guides below contain more information about this migration:

[Angular Migration Guide](https://ionicframework.com/docs/angular/slides)<br />
[React Migration Guide](https://ionicframework.com/docs/react/slides)<br />
[Vue Migration Guide](https://ionicframework.com/docs/vue/slides)

### Textarea

1. Update any code that accesses the `detail` payload for the `ionInput` event from `event.detail` to `event.detail.value` as the detail payload is now an object containing a value and an event.

### Toggle

1. Rename any usages of the `--background` and `--background-checked` CSS Variables to `--track-background` and `--track-background-checked`, respectively.

### Virtual Scroll

1. Remove `ion-virtual-scroll` and any associated types. This component has been removed in favor of using virtual scroll solutions provided by JavaScript Frameworks. The guides below contain more information about this migration:

[Angular Migration Guide](https://ionicframework.com/docs/angular/virtual-scroll)<br />
[React Migration Guide](https://ionicframework.com/docs/react/virtual-scroll)<br />
[Vue Migration Guide](https://ionicframework.com/docs/vue/virtual-scroll)

## Need Help Upgrading?

Be sure to look at the [Ionic 7 Breaking Changes Guide](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-framework/blob/main/BREAKING.md#version-7x).

# Updating from Ionic 7 to 8

:::note
This guide assumes that you have already updated your app to the latest version of Ionic 7. Make sure you have followed the [Upgrading to Ionic 7 Guide](./7-0) before starting this guide.
:::

:::info Breaking Changes
For a **complete list of breaking changes** from Ionic 7 to Ionic 8, please refer to [the breaking changes document](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-framework/blob/main/BREAKING.md#version-8x) in the Ionic Framework repository.
:::

## Getting Started

### Angular

1. Ionic 8 supports Angular 16+. Update to the latest version of Angular by following the [Angular Update Guide](https://update.angular.io/).

2. Update to the latest version of Ionic 8:

```shell
npm install @ionic/angular@latest
```

If you are using Ionic Angular Server and Ionic Angular Toolkit, be sure to update those as well:

```shell
npm install @ionic/angular@latest @ionic/angular-server@latest @ionic/angular-toolkit@11
```

> Note: `@ionic/angular-toolkit@11` requires a minimum of Angular 17. If you are still on Angular 16, then you may want to only update to to `@ionic/angular-toolkit@10` instead.

3. Update any `IonBackButtonDelegate` imports from `@ionic/angular` to import `IonBackButton` from `@ionic/angular` instead.

### React

1. Ionic 8 supports React 17+. Update to the latest version of React:

```shell
npm install react@17 react-dom@17
```

2. Update to the latest version of Ionic 8:

```shell
npm install @ionic/react@8 @ionic/react-router@8
```

### Vue

1. Ionic 8 supports Vue 3.0.6+. Update to the latest version of Vue:

npm install vue@^3.0.6 vue-router@^3.0.6
```

2. Update to the latest version of Ionic 8:

```shell
npm install @ionic/vue@8 @ionic/vue-router@8
```

### Core

1. Update to the latest version of Ionic 8:

```shell
npm install @ionic/core@8
```

## Recommended Changes

The following changes are not required to update to Ionic 8 as your application will continue to work. However, we recommend making the following changes to ensure you can use the new features in Ionic 8.

### Light Palette

Previous versions defined a set of default color variables for the light palette in `theme/variables.scss`:

```css
/** Ionic CSS Variables **/
:root {
  /** primary **/
  --ion-color-primary: #3880ff;
  --ion-color-primary-rgb: 56, 128, 255;
  --ion-color-primary-contrast: #ffffff;
  --ion-color-primary-contrast-rgb: 255, 255, 255;
  /* ... */
}
```

In Ionic Framework version 8, these color variables are included as long as `core.css` is imported. The color variables defined in `theme/variables.scss` should be removed to avoid overriding the imported default variables and ensure the app is always using the latest palette.

Developers who are customizing this color palette can continue to keep the custom variables values, but any of the variables that use the default values should be removed.

You can read more about the new color palette in the [Ionic v8 announcement](https://ionic.io/blog/announcing-the-ionic-8-beta).

### Dark Palette

In previous versions, it was recommended to define the dark palette in the following way:

```css
@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  body {
    /* global app variables */
  }

  .ios body {
    /* global ios app variables */
  }

  .md body {
    /* global md app variables */
  }
}
```

In Ionic Framework version 8, the dark palette is being distributed via css files that can be imported. Below is an example of importing a dark palette file in Angular:

```css
/* @import '@ionic/angular/css/palettes/dark.always.css'; */
/* @import "@ionic/angular/css/palettes/dark.class.css"; */
@import '@ionic/angular/css/palettes/dark.system.css';
```

The dark palette is now applied to the `:root` selector instead of the `body` selector. The [`:root`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:root) selector represents the `<html>` element and is identical to the selector `html`, except that its specificity is higher.

While migrating to include the new dark palette files is unlikely to cause breaking changes, these new selectors can lead to unexpected overrides if custom CSS variables are being set on the `body` element. We recommend updating any instances where global application variables are set to target the `:root` selector instead.

For more information on the new dark palette files, refer to the [Dark Mode documentation](../theming/dark-mode).

### Step Color Tokens

To better support the high contrast palette in Ionic 8, separate step colors tokens have been introduced for text and background color. Previously both text and background color were controlled by a single set of `--ion-color-step-[number]` tokens.

Using the newly imported dark palette mentioned above will also import these new step color tokens. However, developers will need to update any step color tokens that were manually defined in an application.

`--ion-color-step-[number]` usages for **background color** can be migrated by renaming the token to `--ion-background-color-step-[number]`.

**Before**:

```html
button { background: var(--ion-color-step-400); }
```

**After**:

```html
button { background: var(--ion-background-color-step-400); }
```

`--ion-color-step-[number]` usages for **text color** can be migrated by renaming the token to `--ion-text-color-step-[number]` and subtracting the number from 1000.

**Before**:

```html
button { color: var(--ion-color-step-400); }
```

**After**:

```html
button { color: var(--ion-text-color-step-600); /* 1000 - 400 = 600 */ }
```

The [stepped color generator](../theming/themes#stepped-color-generator) has been updated to generate text and background color stepped variables.

### Dynamic Font

The `core.css` file has been updated to enable dynamic font scaling by default.

The `--ion-default-dynamic-font` variable has been removed and replaced with `--ion-dynamic-font`.

Developers who had previously chosen dynamic font scaling by activating it in their global stylesheets can revert to the default setting by removing their custom CSS. In doing so, their application will seamlessly continue utilizing dynamic font scaling as it did before. It's essential to note that altering the font-size of the html element should be avoided, as it may disrupt the proper functioning of dynamic font scaling.

Developers who want to disable dynamic font scaling can set `--ion-dynamic-font: initial;` in their global stylesheets. However, this is not recommended because it may introduce accessibility challenges for users who depend on enlarged font sizes.

For more information on the dynamic font, refer to the [Dynamic Font Scaling documentation](../layout/dynamic-font-scaling).

### (Angular Only) `angular.json` CSS import order

The `angular.json` file currently imports `src/theme/variables.scss` before importing `src/global.scss`. This may cause the incorrect styles to be applied when customizing the new [Dark Palette](#dark-palette) changes.

We recommend importing the `src/global.scss` file first instead:

**Before**:

```json
  "styles": ["src/theme/variables.scss", "src/global.scss"],
```

**After**:

```json
  "styles": ["src/global.scss", "src/theme/variables.scss"],
```

## Required Changes

### Browser Support

The list of browsers that Ionic supports has changed. Review the [Browser Support Guide](../reference/browser-support) to ensure you are deploying apps to supported browsers.

If you have a `browserslist` or `.browserslistrc` file, update it with the following content:

```
Chrome >=89
ChromeAndroid >=89
Firefox >=75
Edge >=89
Safari >=15
iOS >=15
```

### Checkbox

1. Migrate any remaining instances of Checkbox to use the [modern form control syntax](../v7/api/checkbox#migrating-from-legacy-checkbox-syntax). Additionally, remove any usages of the `legacy` property as the legacy form control syntax has been removed.

### Input

1. Remove any usages of the `size` property. CSS should be used to specify the visible width of the input instead.
2. Remove any usages of the `accept` property.
3. Migrate any remaining instances of Input to use the [modern form control syntax](../v7/api/input#migrating-from-legacy-input-syntax). Additionally, remove any usages of the `legacy` property as the legacy form control syntax has been removed.

### Item

1. Remove any usages of the `counter` or `counterFormatter` properties. Use the properties of the same names on `ion-input` and `ion-textarea` instead.
2. Remove any usages of the `helper` or `error` slots. Use the `helperText` and `errorText` properties on `ion-input` and `ion-textarea` instead.
3. Remove any usages of the `fill` or `shape` properties. Use the properties of the same names on `ion-input`, `ion-textarea`, and `ion-select` instead.

### Nav

1. Update any usages of `getLength` to `await` the call before accessing the returned value as this method now returns `Promise<number>` instead of `number`.

### Picker

1. Ionic 8 now ships with an inline `ion-picker` component. Developers who wish to continue using the legacy picker should update any `ion-picker` usages to `ion-picker-legacy`. The `pickerController` import remains unchanged. Note that the `ion-picker-legacy` component will be removed in an upcoming major release of Ionic. Refer to the [Picker documentation](../api/picker) for usage information.

### Toast

1. Remove any usages of the `cssClass` property from `ToastButton`. The `button` CSS Shadow Part should be used instead.

### Radio

1. Migrate any remaining instances of Radio to use the [modern form control syntax](../v7/api/radio#migrating-from-legacy-radio-syntax). Additionally, remove any usages of the `legacy` property as the legacy form control syntax has been removed.

### Select

1. Migrate any remaining instances of Select to use the [modern form control syntax](../v7/api/select#migrating-from-legacy-select-syntax). Additionally, remove any usages of the `legacy` property as the legacy form control syntax has been removed.

### Textarea

1. Migrate any remaining instances of Textarea to use the [modern form control syntax](../v7/api/textarea#migrating-from-legacy-textarea-syntax). Additionally, remove any usages of the `legacy` property as the legacy form control syntax has been removed.

### Toggle

1. Migrate any remaining instances of Toggle to use the [modern form control syntax](../v7/api/toggle#migrating-from-legacy-toggle-syntax). Additionally, remove any usages of the `legacy` property as the legacy form control syntax has been removed.

  <title>Animations: Web Animations API to Build and Run on Ionic Apps</title>
  <meta

    content="Ionic apps use Web Animations API to build and run animations. Learn how this utility lets developers build complex animations in a platform agnostic manner."
  />
</head>

## Overview

Ionic Animations is a tool that enables developers to create complex animations in a platform-agnostic manner, without requiring a specific framework or an Ionic app.

Creating efficient animations can be challenging, as developers are limited by the available libraries and hardware resources of the device. Moreover, many animation libraries use a JavaScript-driven approach, which can reduce the scalability of animations and use up CPU time.

Ionic Animations, on the other hand, uses the [Web Animations API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Animations_API), which offloads all the computation and running of animations to the browser. This approach allows the browser to optimize the animations and ensure their smooth execution. In cases where Web Animations are not supported, Ionic Animations will fall back to [CSS Animations](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Animations/Using_CSS_animations), which should have a negligible difference in performance.

## Basic Animations

In the example below, an animation that changes the opacity on the `ion-card` element and moves it from left to right along the X axis has been created. This animation will run an infinite number of times, and each iteration of the animation will last 1500ms.

By default, all Ionic Animations are paused until the `play` method is called.

import Basic from '@site/static/usage/v8/animations/basic/index.md';

<Basic />

## Keyframe Animations

Ionic Animations allows you to control the intermediate steps in an animation using keyframes. Any valid CSS property can be used here, and you can even use CSS Variables as values.

Hyphenated CSS properties should be written using camel case when writing keyframes. For example, `border-radius` should be written as `borderRadius`. This also applies to the `fromTo()`, `from(),` and `to()` methods.

import Keyframes from '@site/static/usage/v8/animations/keyframes/index.md';

<Keyframes />

In the example above, the card element will transition from its initial width, to a width defined by the `--width` variable, and then transition on to the final width.

Each keyframe object contains an `offset` property. `offset` is a value between 0 and 1 that defines the keyframe step. Offset values must go in ascending order and cannot repeat.

## Grouped Animations

Multiple elements can be animated at the same time and controlled via a single parent animation object. Child animations inherit properties such as duration, easing, and iterations unless otherwise specified. A parent animation's `onFinish` callback will not be called until all child animations have completed.

This example shows 3 child animations controlled by a single parent animation. Animations `cardA` and `cardB` inherit the parent animation's duration of 2000ms, but animation `cardC` has a duration of 5000ms since it was explicitly set.

import Group from '@site/static/usage/v8/animations/group/index.md';

<Group />

## Before and After Hooks

Ionic Animations provides hooks that let you alter an element before an animation runs and after an animation completes. These hooks can be used to perform DOM reads and writes as well as add or remove classes and inline styles.

This example sets an inline filter which inverts the background color of the card by `75%` prior to the animation starting. Once the animation finishes, the box shadow on the element is set to `rgba(255, 0, 50, 0.4) 0px 4px 16px 6px`, a red glow, and the inline filter is cleared. The animation must be stopped in order to remove the box shadow and play it with the filter again.

See [Methods](#methods) for a complete list of hooks.

import BeforeAndAfterHooks from '@site/static/usage/v8/animations/before-and-after-hooks/index.md';

<BeforeAndAfterHooks />

## Chained Animations

Animations can be chained to run one after the other. The `play` method returns a Promise that resolves when the animation has completed.

import Chain from '@site/static/usage/v8/animations/chain/index.md';

<Chain />

## Gesture Animations

Ionic Animations gives developers the ability to create powerful gesture-based animations by integrating seamlessly with [Ionic Gestures](gestures.md).

In the following example we are creating a track along which we can drag the card element. Our `animation` object will take care of moving the card element either left or right, and our `gesture` object will instruct the `animation` object which direction to move in.

import Gesture from '@site/static/usage/v8/animations/gesture/index.md';

<Gesture />

## Preference-Based Animations

Developers can also tailor their animations to user preferences such as `prefers-reduced-motion` and `prefers-color-scheme` using CSS Variables.

This method works in all supported browsers when creating animations for the first time. Most browsers are also capable of dynamically updating keyframe animations as the CSS Variables change.

Safari does not currently support dynamically updating keyframe animations. For developers who need this kind of support in Safari, they can use [MediaQueryList.addListener()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaQueryList/addListener).

import PreferenceBased from '@site/static/usage/v8/animations/preference-based/index.md';

<PreferenceBased />

## Overriding Ionic Component Animations

Certain Ionic components allow developers to provide custom animations. All animations are provided as either properties on the component or are set via a global config.

### Modals

import ModalOverride from '@site/static/usage/v8/animations/modal-override/index.md';

<ModalOverride />

## Performance Considerations

CSS and Web Animations are usually handled on the compositor thread. This is different than the main thread where layout, painting, styling, and your JavaScript is executed. It is recommended that you prefer using properties that can be handled on the compositor thread for optimal animation performance.

Animating properties such as `height` and `width` cause additional layouts and paints which can cause jank and degrade animation performance. On the other hand, animating properties such as `transform` and `opacity` are highly optimizable by the browser and typically do not cause much jank.

For information on which CSS properties cause layouts or paints to occur, see [CSS Triggers](https://csstriggers.com/).

## Debugging

For debugging animations in Chrome, there is a great blog post about inspecting animations using the Chrome DevTools: https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/inspect-styles/animations.

It is also recommended to assign unique identifiers to your animations. These identifiers will show up in the Animations inspector in Chrome and should make it easier to debug:

  <title>Gestures | Ionic App Utility for Custom Gestures and Interactions</title>

## Overview

Ionic Gestures is a utility that allows developers to build custom gestures and interactions for their application in a platform agnostic manner. Developers do not need to be using a particular framework such as React or Angular, nor do they even need to be building an Ionic app! As long as developers have access to v5.0 or greater of Ionic Framework, they will have access to all of Ionic Gestures.

Building complex gestures can be time consuming. Other libraries that provide custom gestures are often times too heavy handed and end up capturing mouse or touch events and not letting them propagate. This can result in other elements no longer being scrollable or clickable.

## Installation

Developers using Angular should install the latest version of `@ionic/angular`. Gestures can be created via the `GestureController` dependency injection.

By default, gesture callbacks do not run inside of NgZone. Developers can either set the `runInsideAngularZone` parameter to `true` when creating a gesture,
or they can wrap their callbacks in an `NgZone.run()` call.

```tsx
import { Gesture, GestureController } from '@ionic/angular';

...

constructor(private gestureCtrl: GestureController) {
  const gesture: Gesture = this.gestureCtrl.create({
    el: this.element.nativeElement,
    threshold: 15,
    gestureName: 'my-gesture',
    onMove: event => this.onMoveHandler(event)
  }, true);
  // The `true` above ensures that callbacks run inside NgZone.

## Basic Gestures

import Basic from '@site/static/usage/v8/gestures/basic/index.md';

In this example, our app listens for gestures on the `ion-content` element. When a gesture movement has started, the `onStart` function is called and a class is added to our `ion-card` to add a colored box shadow. When a gesture movement was detected, the `onMove` function is called and our app prints the current gesture information within the `ion-card`. Finally, when a gesture movement has ended, the `onEnd` function is called and the custom class is removed from our `ion-card`.

## Double Click Gesture

import DoubleClick from '@site/static/usage/v8/gestures/double-click/index.md';

In the example below, we want to be able to detect double clicks on an element. By setting our `threshold` to `0`, we can ensure our gesture object can detect clicks. Additionally, we define a click threshold so that only 2 clicks that occur in quick succession count as a double click.

## Methods

#### `enable(enable: boolean = true) => void`

Enable or disable the gesture.

#### `destroy() => void`

Destroy the gesture instance and stop listening on the target element.
